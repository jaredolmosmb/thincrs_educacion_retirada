Es difícil de creer a primera vista, pero son nuestros miedos, limitaciones y creencias limitantes respecto a nosotros mismos y al mundo que nos rodean que nos impiden realizar las actividades que sabemos que tenemos que hacer para obtener los resultados que queremos alcanzar.En este curso, nos enfocaremos justamente en reconocer en primera instancia, que es realmente la procrastinación, de tal manera que logremos identificar cuáles son los factores personales que nos están llevando a procrastinar y a dejar de lado lo que consideramos importante para nuestra vida.Teniendo esto claro, nos enfocaremos en crear hábitos que nos permita culminar nuestras tareas más fácilmente y ser más productivos en cada una de las áreas de nuestra vida en las cuales nos hemos fijado una meta concreta.Este curso ha sido creado de un procrastinador para los procrastinadores, de tal manera que no se convierta en un curso que repite libros de texto y de autoayuda, que ofrecen técnicas exprés que a largo plazo no tienen utilidad.Este curso es para aquellas personas comprometidas en crear un cambio contundente y radical en su vida, eliminando aquellos hábitos que no les permiten avanzar en su vida y crear aquellos que los lleven mucho más lejos de las metas que se han propuesto.Si estás dispuesto a trabajar en ti, ¡Bienvenido al curso!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/destruye-la-procrastinacion/,366,Secundaria Desarrollo Personal Personal Growth,69,64,David Bejarano,"Tener dificultades para comenzar ciertas actividades, tareas, procesos o metas.

Are your interviews failing to produce enough reliable information to pick consistent ‘winners’? Are you missing out on the best candidates, often losing them to the competition?Whether you’re a seasoned HR professional or an entry-level recruiter, job market insider and hiring strategist Ryan Lecour shares his refreshing blueprint to guide you through the interviewing and hiring process with a step-by-step method that secures the best fit every time.The interview is the only window you have for observing candidates. Business-building and team-transforming decisions are based on these limited and precious hours. Many take credit for the quote ‘a company is only as good as its people'. Truer words cannot be said. And the interview is ground zero for determining how good your company is going to be.In this course, Ryan teaches invaluable foundations on interview planning  execution. Students will learn essential strategies for question building, test administration and candidate evaluation. They’ll also learn key tactics for achieving clarity and verification with candidate profiles, personalities and work history. The course upholds a constant respect for the crucial role the interview plays in determining the fate of companies in areas of team-building and employee selection.Learn to hire consistent winners with proven interview techniques from a leading recruiting strategistThe following are some of the key things you will learn how to do in this course:Cut to the heart of the truth with penetrating sequences of probing questions that reveal critical details surrounding the candidate’s career change historyIdentify the elements of strong and weak candidate questions and learn to evaluate how they contribute to the overall strength of the candidacyBring awareness to unconscious biases that tend to creep into the process and mitigate or eliminate their effect while restoring objectivity and sound evaluationLead the stakeholder synchronization meeting with an organized method that efficiently captures the various dimensions of the position and sets the table for the interview planEstablish preemptive compensation discussions early in the interview process and setup foundations for favorable offer negotiationsBuild an interview kit that guides the interview and ensures the best use of time for all personnel involved in the processRyan draws on nearly a decade of experience witnessing how the interview has the power and influence to ‘make or break’ companies. From supplying key personnel to the offices of Apple, Google and many other Fortune 100 companies, to starting and operating his own successful HR firm, Ryan has learned that decisions on matters of hiring are difficult and almost always based on incomplete information.

In version 6 of the course, you have access to a brand new series of animations that make full use of Udemy's new assignments feature and a new section on designing a longer-term career plan.Udemy's Assignments enable you to receive guided instructions, use your skills, and then see how your instructor does something. We've leveraged this feature by taking the most challenging parts of the Career Hacking™ course and making them easier for you through the use of these guided assignments. For example, when you reach the point in the course where you need to develop bulletpoints for your resume / CV, you'll find an animated Assignment that takes you through the process step-by-step, gives you a chance to develop your own resume bulletpoint using what you've learned in the course, and then shows you how it's done by your instructor.Many of you have also asked for help developing a mid and long-term career plan. In version 6, we've added an additional section to help you. First, you'll learn soft skills that will help you transition to working with a new team and/or at a new job. Then you will have the opportunity to use the VISTA career planning tool that we've built for you so that you can align your values, interests, skills, and more with your career goals.One of the new videos that we've added for you is an interview with Stephen Szermer, someone who successfully completed a big mid-life career change. His story will help anyone who is in a career rut, needs to change careers, or feels like the world has evolved past their existing skill set. We hope you enjoy Career Hacking™ version 6!January 7th, 2019: What's new in version 6.1?We've migrated some of the guides and course tools to Google Drive so that they're usable across all of your devices and easier to use than .pdfs!April 9th, 2019: What's new in version 6.2?You all are amazing! We want to harness the collective power of the Career Hacking™ community to make the course better for you and other future students, so we've added the ability for you to contribute your ideas related to new content and course features through a simple, anonymous feedback mechanism. Thanks for working with us to make your learning experience awesome!June 21st, 2019:What's new in version 6.3? We've just made a HUGEupgrade to your course. Specifically, we:Remastered all videos in the course. We realize that, over the years, we exported videos with varying volume levels. This was causing some of you to have to frequently adjust the volume settings on your playback devices, so Davis spent time remastering the volume across the entire Career Hacking™ learning experience. We've heard many of you ask for additional support with mid and later-life career changes, so Davis spent quite a lot of time creating a comprehensive presentation specifically tailored to the needs of people going through a mid or later-life career change. You can find this presentation in the text lecture where all of the course resources are listed and in a special optional lecture in the career strategy section of the course.The LinkedIn® PowerGame is now a fundamental part of your learning experience.Previously, it was an optional video. We did this because being able to engage in professional networking on LinkedIn® is increasingly important for many careers.Davis migrated two videos that were previously presented in-stream in the course to optional videos. The first video that has been converted to optional viewing is one on tips for people going into a coding interview and the second is for CareerHackers looking to get a USVisa. Because these are specialized scenarios, we want to make sure that they're taken by those who need them, not everyone who participates in Career Hacking™. November 1, 2019:What's new in version 6.4?You've asked and we've delivered!Career Hacking™ is now fully closed captioned in English so that you can clearly understand key CareerHacking™ concepts and so that students whose first language isn't English can have a fuller learning experience and develop their English skills while taking the course!We're introducing a suite of Voices from the Field lectures.This lecture style is something that Davis learned while participating in Harvard's Leaders of Learning program. In each lecture, we pose an important career management question to experts with a variety of professional expertise and backgrounds so that you can get multiple informed viewpoints on these topics. In this update, we feature experts with experience in technical recruiting, in placing candidates looking for work after receiving professional certificates, in helping MBAgraduates get jobs, in coaching executives in Silicon Valley, and in breaking into the financial services sector. Thanks for joining us in the Career Hacking™ course!January 4, 2020:What's new in version 6.5?When you're searching for a job, keeping records of your applications and managing your professional network are super important. Previously, we showed you how to take care of these problems using Podio® as your ""Job Search CRM"" platform. However, Podio® is really designed to be used by teams for much more complex activities, so Davis Jones, this course's designer, built a custom tool for Career Hacking™ participants that's built on top of Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. It's called the Career Hacking™ Hub. This free software keeps all of your information private (essentially, it's a modified Google Sheet that you own), and it pairs perfectly with what you learn in your Career Hacking™ learning experience. You should find this tool convenient, free, and helpful. You can learn more about it inside the course. We're always trying to add value for you and to support your success!Welcome to Career Hacking™ 6.5.January 14, 2020: What's new in version 6.5.1?Your fellow Career Hacker David Williamson contributed a valuable new career hack related to uncovering small and medium-sized businesses who don't often advertise higher-level positions publicly. It's been added in the description of the ""Hidden Job Market""module. Thanks David!March 13th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.2?You'll find a new SideBySide that walks you through using the new Career Hacking™ Hub App. This should enable you to get up and running with the newest technology feature of the Career Hacking™ course quickly!April 20th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.3?We've started responding to the Coronavirus pandemic by adding additional resources to yourCareer Hacking™ experience.July 30th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.4?After auditing CareerHacking™, we found that some of the course's resources were difficult for mobile users to access. So, we've upgraded the way we saved and uploaded your Career Hacking™ resources, and also added multiple cloud-based (Google Drive)resources.This should make it easier for you to take your CareerHacking™ on mobile devices, and in situations when your access to broadband may be limited.November 2020:What's new in version 6.6?Wow. There are a BUNCHof new updates to your Career Hacking™ course!You have a completely rebuilt resume-writing section. Specifically, your course has transitioned to building your resume in Google Docs by default. This has a number of benefits for you:Your resume is now mobile-friendly. This is increasingly important, because your career conversations are now taking place, in the earliest stages at least, via messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp®, LinkedIn® messenger, Twitter®, DMs, etc.). In those situations, the person on the other end of your message is most likely on a mobile device. Now, when you send them your resume, it will open to a perfectly-formatted, mobile-friendly version.ALL of the Career Hackers in this course will now be able to create best-in-class resumes using the templates provided--whether you have access to Microsoft Word® (a paid software program) or not. Transitioning to Google Docs® makes your Career Hacking™ course more diverse and inclusive for our global Career Hacking™ community.You'll now be able to short link to your resume. This will make it easier for you to share your resume, and you'll look like the tech-savvy person you are when you do it.You'll still be able to export your resume to traditional formats (like PDF and .doc).Important note: You can ABSOLUTELY still use Microsoft Word to build your resume. The course fully supports Microsoft Word®, Pages (Mac), and other word processing softwares.You have a completely rebuilt LinkedIn® section. In recent years, LinkedIn® has made a number of important updates to the layout of the platform, how features are arranged, and how media is presented. So, your new Career Hacking™ course has brand new, fresh tutorials to enable you to take advantage of the Platform's most important tools and features.New content on pre-interviewing and digital messaging. According to our network of labor market experts, an increasing number of career relationships are starting with informal message swaps. For example, you may connect with a recruiter on LinkedIn® and then immediately exchange a few career-related messages with them. Your new Career Hacking™ course embraces this new reality, and equips you with the tools to succeed in these message exchanges. This part of the recruiting process, which we call ""pre-interviewing"", is now covered in the Course.Increased support for remote workers and applying for remote opportunities. An increasing number of roles are remote or partially remote, and these opportunities appeal to many Career Hackers. So, we've integrated a number of changes to your resume-writing, networking, and LinkedIn® profile design approaches that enable you to increase your ability to succeed in the distributed work environment.We've added new Voices from the Field and interview lectures.We've updated your LinkedIn® and resume writing guides, with brand new content that aligns with changes to the respective platforms, approaches, and wording practices involved in creating a stand-out professional profile. Enjoy the updates!November 2020:What's new in version 6.6.1?Your course has a bunch of fresh new links.

Specifically, we've added a new ""Voices from the Field"" lecture where you'll meet a wide variety of professionals who share how they'd like to be approached on LinkedIn® for new networking opportunities. We've also invested in new content for you around the legality of using images sourced from previous employers or partners on your LinkedIn® profile--an area of content for which we have received a number of requests.We've added additional resources for those of you looking to transition into technology roles.We've upgraded many of your tools around using LinkedIn® for networking and for ""pre-interviewing"", because we're seeing an increasing amount of job search activity happening on LinkedIn®.Enjoy the updates!!January 2022:What's new in version 6.7.1?In this update, we've added professionally-developed English-language subtitles to all of the new lectures that were published in the recent upgrade.

You’ve got all the strategies you need in this growth hacking course.   In the first part of the course, you’ll gain essential “big picture” skills, including developing your customer personas, interviewing your target markets, and analyzing your “buyer center” (i.e. the individuals in your target market with the most purchasing power).   Next, you’ll learn how to analyze your results. With any growth hacking effort, you always want to know what’s working, where it’s working, and what needs to be changed. For this, you need digital marketing tools like web traffic analysis and lean analytics.  Lastly, you’ll discover highly effective tools to bring boatloads of new customers – ones with money to spend – into your online eco-system. This includes the concepts of digital conversion funnels, lifetime customer value (LTV), and customer acquisition costs (CAC). 

 Develop a User-Centric Approach to Digital Marketing You’ll start by learning what growth hacking is and then move on to building your digital analytics skills.We'll take your Google Analytics skills to the next level by teaching you how to use these advanced tools with real data from the Google Merchandise Store. Then, you'll learn how to develop marketing personas and user segments--using online research methods (like Facebook Audience Insights) and the person-to-person interviewing methods used by companies like IDEOand Apple in Silicon Valley. Then, you'll learn how to work with Pirate Metrics and marketing funnels so that you can guide potential customers through each step... from awareness to revenue to referrals.In the second half of the course, you’ll discover how to create digital marketing materials that target the unique wants and needs of your customer. This might seem like a given, right? In fact, it’s a much rarer skill than you might think, and absolutely crucial for maximizing sales. No growth hacking course is complete without this must-know info! Then you’ll get a crash course in both online SEO and in content marketing, allowing you create relevant and memorable content that’s designed to be discoverable on the web. The email marketing section will introduce you to automated strategies for email. You’ll also develop the ability to use email platforms to manage your subscriber lists.In the later parts of the course, you'll learn how to estimate and use both LifetimeCustomerValue (LTV)and Customer AcquisitionCosts (CAC)--two critical metrics for building a digital marketing engine. The course wraps up with a section on paid acquisition(like PPC Ads andsocial media ads) so that you can bring traffic into the ""top of your funnel"" on-demand.Also, this is version 7 of this course!

PRACTICAL TRAINING WITH REAL SPATIAL DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















DEVELOP MAD GIS SKILLS AND PERFORM SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS USING FREE KICKASS TOOLS SUCH AS QGIS, R, GRASS AND GOOGLE EARTH. 

















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















This course is designed to take users who use R and QGIS for basic spatial data/GIS analysis to perform more advanced GIS tasks (including automated workflows and geo-referencing) using a variety of different data. In addition to making you proficient in R and QGIS for spatial data analysis, you will be introduced to another powerful free GIS software.. GRASS.

















This course takes a completely practical approach to spatial data analysis and mapping- Each lecture will teach you a practical application/processing technique which you can apply easily.

















The course is taught by Minerva Singh, A PhD graduate from Cambridge University, UK, who has several years of research experience in Quantitative Ecology and an MPhil in Geography and Environment from Oxford University. Minerva has published papers in international peer reviewed journals and given talks at international conferences.  

















The underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can put spatial data analysis into practice today and develop sound GIS analysis skills. You’ll be able to start analyzing spatial data for your own projects, and IMPRESS YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYERS with examples of your PRACTICAL spatial data analysis abilities. This course is different from other training resources. Each lecture seeks to enhance your GIS skills in a demonstrable and tangible manner and provide you with practically implementable GIS solutions.

















This is an intermediate course in spatial data analysis, i.e. we will build on on basic spatial data analysis tasks (such as those covered in the beginner version course: Core Spatial Data Analysis: Introductory GIS with R and QGIS) and teach users how to practically implement more complex GIS tasks such as interpolation, mapping spatial data, geo-referencing and detailed vector processing. Additionally you will be introduced to preliminary geo-statistics and mapping/visualizing spatial data. 

















This course covers complex GIS techniques, and by completing this course, you will be implementing these PRACTICALLY in freely-available software, thus making you MORE ATTRACTIVE TO EMPLOYERS.  

















It is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend a tiny amount of time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts pertaining to the different spatial data analysis techniques demonstrated in the course. However, majority of the course will focus on working with real spatial data from different sources. After each video you will learn how to practically implement a new concept or technique in the different softwares used for the course.

















During the course of my research I have discovered that R is a powerful tool for collating and analyzing spatial data acquired from different sources.  Proficiency in spatial data analysis in R and QGIS has helped me publish more peer reviewed papers faster. Feel free to check out my profile on ResearchGate.

















FREE BONUS: You will have access to all the data used in the course, along with the R code files. You will also have access to future lectures, resources and R code files. Enroll in the course today  take advantage of this special bonus!

















I don’t have to remind you that we have a RISK-FREE GUARANTEE in the case of you not being satisfied with the course. Take action now!

87,3491366,*NEW* Advanced Forms - 2022 Build & Master Web forms,"THENITTYGRITTYOFWEBFORMS?A web form is also known as an HTML form. It’s a place where users can enter data that’s then sent to a server for processing. Web forms allow users to place orders on your site, to provide their name and email address to sign up for a newsletter, or to sign up as a member to your site and so forth.What’s really great about web forms is that there is no “one size fits all”. You can use your artistic flare, and personal business acumen to create web forms with a particular length, format, content type and appearance.By doing this course, you’ll be able to improve your web form usability, which will ultimately enhance user experience and get website visitors excited about completing your form and converting.Why is this course so important?Forms which are on point present an opportunity for a company to grow and capture loyalty.A form can often be both a marketing tool and a necessity. A form that puts the user at ease, that evokes feelings of trust, will get filled out far more often than a form which looks (or is) complicated and confusing. After completing my “Advanced Forms” course, you will be knowledgeable, confident and the “go-to” person for forms.Let me share my form building skills with youUnderstanding how forms work will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master forms and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering a perfect, interactive and functional form is challenging. In this course, I take a deep-dive into explaining web forms and how they work. Why do we need to wrap our form within form tags? How can you include a progress bar in a form? How can you customize a toggle or checkbox? Where does the data go once a user clicks on the submit button? How can you perform validation on your form? How can a user upload a file? What happens once the data arrives at the server? What are the different types of events we can listen to on forms? By understanding these questions, and many more in the course, you will be able to build advanced forms and better yet, understand the full stack process! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic forms that improve user engagement and experience.WHATTHISCOURSECOVERSThis course is huge and comprehensive, from basics to advancedThis course will give you solid fundamentals and practicals regarding forms. It can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from this course with an advanced understanding and practical experience with building forms. It will take you to the point where you will understand what method (GET or POST) to use when sending form data, how to define where the data goes, how to perform advanced client-side validation (checking errors on the form before it is sent to the server), how to write custom pattern validation rules (using regular expressions), how to run servers and how to view all HTTP request information. This is awesome knowledge. This course will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end form web development.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” FORMS by gaining an understanding of how you can build it, manipulate it and style it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Why should you learn so much about forms?A web form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a relationship with them. The time you spend in bringing the user to your website should be matched with the time spent in perfecting the user experience with your web forms. It is surprising to see so many sites these days contain complex and frustrating web forms that cause a negative experience.Ultimately, a web form allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalogue request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database.Can you begin to see how important forms are and how their use can be escalated?*** A comprehensive FORMScourse on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how HTML code works behind the scenes. This is particularly true when it comes to building forms. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know, really know, how forms work. You need to understand how the browser URL encodes form data, how the browser sends data to a URL that you specify, and how to perform validation to ensure the user does not submit invalid data.A unique approachYou will learn ""why"" things work and not just ""how"". Understanding advanced topics about forms (lURL encoding, accept-charset, multipart/form-data, regex, etc) is important as it will give you infinite possibilities and upskill you. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create forms that are tailored to your needs, and allow the form data to get submitted to a server via AJAX. You will be able to create forms that are customizable by the user (for example, if the user wants to change the color of the form theme). You can create a control on a form that displays the progress completion of the form and displays messages to the user along the way.Can you begin to see how pivotal forms are and how important having knowledge about forms is?How is this course different?There are lots of courses that focus on web development. Many never get into the detail about how HTML forms work behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master in order to utilize potential.In this course, I focus on the more advanced topics of true web development when it comes to forms. This includes understanding what all of the attributes on the form element mean, understanding the different input types in detail, what URL encoding is, and how data is sent over the wire to a server.Practice makes perfectTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.I love practical examples, which is why we build multiple forms in this course, starting in section 1.Is this course for you?Absolutely. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:Student #1: You want to advance in the world of programming.Student #2: You want to know how successful developers build dynamic forms that engage with the user, have high conversions that put them ahead of the competition.Student #3: You want to gain a solid understanding of how forms really workStudent #4: You want to start using backend technologies like Node or PHP with formsWHY START NOW?Right this second, your competitors are learning how to become better web developers.Web development is a blazing hot topic at the moment, and in the foreseeable future. But you have a distinct advantage. This course offers memorable learning topics, actionable tactics and real-world examples.Lets get started!What do you get?Lifetime access to all tutorial videos. No fees or monthly subscriptions.QA support.Quizzes, coding challenges, a test and assignments to help you learn.I’ve allowed you to download all of my lectures for offline viewing.Let's get excited about becoming a professional web developer, and to be able to confidently apply it to your own websites.See you in the lectures.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/master-web-forms/,1301,Web Development,245,217,Clyde Matthew,"A desire to become an informed full stack web developer

88,2696476,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 1,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youUnderstanding the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. How exactly does the browser model your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Where can we access this model? What can we do with this model? How can we change this model? By understanding these questions, you will be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 1 of 2This course is the first course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do Course 2) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 1 with a basic understanding and practical experience. It will take you to the point where you will understand what the DOM is, why we need it, how to access it, where to find it and how to manipulate it. This is awesome knowledge. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development.In this course you’ll learn about front-end Web Development, by mastering the Document Object Model.Why do you need to know about the DOM?So, you know some HTML, you’ve created your first tags, learned about CSS, made awesome forms, star-gazing buttons, responsive pages and have started to create dynamic and interesting pages.But now you want to do more: “How can I add animation (and life) to my page? I wish I could give an error message to a user who incorrectly submits a form!”And this is where the DOM comes into the picture. and where this course(s) provide you with an opportunity to grow in your skills.To cut a long story short, we use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.The first step in understanding the DOM is understanding what it is. How does it differ from your HTML markup? How does it differ from JavaScript? From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to access the DOM. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to access and traverse the DOM. We don’t stop here, but then get into more advanced things like manipulating the DOM (via the create and remove methods given to us by the DOM API).Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” DOM by gaining an understanding of where you can find it, how you can access it, and more importantly, how you can manipulate it. We dig deeper in every lecture, learning about things like Nodes, the difference between HTTPCollections vs NodeLists, and a whole bunch more! This course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new remove API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** A must-do Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how your browser represents your HTML code and works behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to deal with the DOM. You need to know how to access it, how to manipulate it, and how to dynamically interact with it.I want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.I want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.This course is perfect for you.DescriptionHi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to learn how successful web developers can create whizbang websites that are dynamic and engaging!The root to understanding how to be a professional front-end web developer is understanding the Document Object Model and applying it to practical situations. We're going to practice and learn and emerge confident to tackle any challenges modern programs and websites throw at us.After completing a few university degrees, and post graduate studies, I developed a fascination for web design and software languages. For several years I have immersed myself in this. I spent a fair bit on top courses and went on to apply the knowledge practically.

89,2733254,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 2,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youMastering the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end web programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. In this advanced course, we take a deep-dive into DOM events. What are they? Why are they important? The different types of events we can listen to? Where do they come from? What is event bubbling and event capturing, and how does it help? By understanding these questions, and more, you'll be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 2 of 2This course is the second and final course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do both courses) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 2 with a solid understanding and practical experience of working with events in the DOM. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development. In this course you’ll learn more about front-end web development, by working with events in the Document Object Model.Why this course?Why do you need to know about events in the DOM?If you've ever wondered how you can add animation (and life) to a page, then you need to understand how events work in the DOM. We use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.This course starts off with understanding what an event is. What are the 2 most important things when it comes to events? What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler? From there, you’ll start exploring the different ways you can add events to your code. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to ‘listen’ for events on your web page and then interact with the page when those events happen. We don’t stop here, but get into more advanced things like learning about how an event travels in the DOM (capturing vs bubbling), which leads us to an even more important topic of ... wait for it ... event delegation. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We go into many other things like DOM extensions, object hierarchy and a bunch of other stuff.Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” DOM by gaining an understanding of how you can manipulate it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new classList API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** An advanced Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code.

Take control through understanding. Delivering a fast web experience requires a lot of work by the browser. Most of this work is hidden from web developers: we write the markup, and a nice looking page comes out on the screen. But how exactly does the browser go from consuming our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rendered pixels on the screen? By understanding this, you will be able to write better code in order to boost your website traffic, know how to precision fix and tweak behaviour and performance, improve your market penetration and your margins. You’ll also gain an advantages over other developers who seem to just push the buttons without fully appreciating what is happening.What this course covers?In this course you’ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path. This refers to the set of steps browsers must take to fetch and then convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living, breathing websites. From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to measure performance. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to deliver the first pixels to the screen as early as possible.Knowledge of the CRP is incredibly useful for understanding how a site's performance can be improved.

Change all of that by enrolling in ""Sourdough Bread Baking 101.""This is the sourdough baking course you need if you are just starting out in sourdough bread baking. In my other courses, I teach how to bake all sorts of sourdough breads, but in this course, I won't load you down with lots of information, just enough so it is easy and fun to bake your first loaf of sourdough. You will first learn how to make your own sourdough starter at home, day by day with detailed instructions, videos and a free pdf downloadable booklet. Next, you'll move onto baking waffles to test your new sourdough starter and then onto your first sourdough test loaf. Once you've taken a basic white sourdough loaf, steaming hot, out of your own oven, you will be ready to move on to more complex formulas. There are two basic sourdough bread formulas in this course. I call them ""First Loaf"" and ""Second Loaf."" We will follow the easy step by step directions of the process together. The first loaf is easy. It is a one day round boule with a lower hydration dough, which means it is not too wet or sticky. The second loaf is a two day high hydration dough and is a batard or French style loaf. Working together, I will show you how to handle a wet, sticky dough and how to do an autolyse. This bread results in a lovely tasting bread with large holes and a wonderful crispy crust. This course is for BEGINNERS who have no idea of how to bake with sourdough or those who have tried and stumbled. I have fifteen years of experience teaching the newbie sourdough baker, so come on! Let's have some fun! You know want to!This course would make an excellent gift for the aspiring baker in your family circle, whether an older baker or a young new baker. Some skills you will learn:How to make and care for your own sourdough starterWhy it's important to weigh ingredients. Gathering some basic baking equipmentHow to mix and fold dough. No kneading here.Shaping, scoring and baking the dough.What to do after you've baked your first loaf... hint (bake your second loaf!)When you have finished Sourdough Bread Baking 101, you will have the confidence to not only bake using your own sourdough starter, you will be ready for more advanced sourdough baking techniques which will enable you to bake all sorts of sourdough artisan breads.

132,430604,12 Strategies for Dealing With Difficult People,"I'm right there with you my friend.  Difficult People Suck!Let me ask a few questions.Are you frustrated with difficult people?Do you find difficult people to be challenging? Who are some difficult people in your life? Your boss? Coworkers and customers? Your spouse/partner? Your kids?Do you feel trapped?Are you losing sleep? (This is a big healthy lifestyle red flag!)Do you pause for a moment to take a deep breath before you go into work, or a meeting, just to prepare yourself for the onslaught you know you are going to deal with?Have you ever looked at your paycheck to see if you have enough sick time built up so you just don't have to go into work today? How did you feel when you realized you didn't have enough time built up and you had to go it? Even sicker? I get it.Again, I'm right there with you my friend. I have lost entire weekends due to the overwhelming stress caused by that one difficult customer I'm scheduled to meet on Monday morning. So much stress I couldn't leave it behind, even for a few hours, to really enjoy time with my family. Does this sentence sound familiar? “Your here but you are not really here.” I get it.Difficult people SUCK!I have screamed at the top of my lungs, in my car, while back fisting the passenger seat headrest to the point I’ve ripped the skin off my knuckles. I even purchased a new mattress and pillow thinking that it might actually help me sleep through the night. It didn’t work. I still didn’t sleep well and the stress just kept building.I’ve purchased Melatonin (sleep aid) even when it wasn’t on a Buy One Get One sale. I can also find the bottle of Tylenol PM in complete darkness at 02:00 AM. I've walked away from jobs, that I've loved, due to a boss being so unreasonably difficult I just couldn't put my job in front of my health any longer. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this, but there must be some sort of science that explains why the air instantly seems fresher the moment you choose to walk (or run) away from a toxic situation.Difficult people are just unhealthy.  I’ve skipped meals because I was too stressed to eat which usually resulted in me hitting a drive-through just because “I just need something.” 40+ pounds later…”Well, this isn’t working for me.” I get it.Difficult people have caused me to be physically sick. I've felt physical back pain because I was so stressed out and tense knowing that I was going to be dealing with difficult co-workers tomorrow.Let me ask a couple more questions:What would it feel like to sleep peacefully throughout the night?Wouldn't it be great to have a few key strategies that make dealing with difficult people a lot easier? What would it feel like to have control of the situation?What would it feel like to be able to leave work behind and enjoy your evening, your weekend, or even your vacation?What would it feel like to actually “Look forward to work tomorrow”?What would it feel like to have the power to “Fire” that one difficult customer that takes up so much of your time, your thoughts, and your work?What if dealing with difficult people actually becomes a fun game you become really good at playing?Once I began to master these strategies, the air became fresher, my sleep improved, and I became healthier and happier.

135,949846,3 Minute French - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Bonjour et bienvenue :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute French as a way to make learning French easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the French language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no French at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak French, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn French.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE FRENCH WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of French that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak French comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a French speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep French fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with French and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning French with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work well.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak French you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute French today.Merci :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-full-course-1/,263,Language Learning,106,82,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no French and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute French courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in French. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the French language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in French, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in French so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute French courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the French structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your French vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-course-2/,266,Language Learning,93,80,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute French Course 1""

We'll look at some new verbs and learn how they are used differently in French to how they're used in English. We'll also begin to look at a very useful tool for new language learners: directions. Learning how to ask for directions is invaluable, because it will very often be one of the easiest ways for you to start to tune your ear into the French language. I'll give you a few tips on how to do this.The sentences in this course might seem a little longer than the ones we've been used to, so far, but this is a great way for you to get your tongue around the French pronunciation.

146,943496,3 Minute German - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Hallo und wilkommen :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute German as a way to make learning German easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the German language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no German at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak German, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn German.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE GERMAN WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of German that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak German comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a German speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep German fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with German and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning German with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak German you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute German today.Danke :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-german-full-course-1/,283,Language Learning,100,89,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no German and nothing about languages

157,979222,3 Minute Portuguese - Course 1 | Lessons for beginners,"Olá e bem-vindo :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute Portuguese as a way to make learning Portuguese easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the Portuguese language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no Portuguese at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak Portuguese, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn Portuguese.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE PORTUGUESE WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of Portuguese that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak Portuguese comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a Portuguese speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep Portuguese fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with Portuguese and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Portuguese with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Portuguese you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Portuguese today.Obrigado :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-portuguese-full-course-1/,220,Language Learning,75,66,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no Portuguese and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute Spanish courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in Spanish. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the Spanish language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in Spanish, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in Spanish so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute Spanish courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the Spanish structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your Spanish vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-spanish-course-2/,288,Language Learning,103,90,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute Spanish Course 1""

I'll show you how to create compelling models, how to use Blender's logic bricks to write basic games with no programming, and we'll finally transition to writing your own code with the powerful and popular Python language built into Blender.  I've had a blast creating this course.  I can't wait to share it with you.  The best part of making a game is storing your own playfulness inside a game.  I see this course in exactly the same way.  Let's play together and build some awesome games.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3d-game-development-with-blender/,671,Game Development,40,40,Andy Harris,"Please download and install a recent version of Blender (2.76 or greater.)

183,1095384,"3ds Max + AE: Learn VFX, Camera Tracking and Compositing","There are few better ways to present a project to your clients than through aerial fly-overs of a proposed building.  Drones have made it easier than ever to aerial footage of your projects sites.  In this course you will learn to take drone footage (or really any kind of footage), whether it is shot by you or someone else, and composite in your 3D creations easily and convincingly. 3DS Max and After Effects already have all the built-in tools that you need for creating visual effects using 3D composited into live footage.  Follow this course and you will be amazed at how quickly and easily you can be up to speed, creating your own movie-like effects, using software you probably already have access to.

This course is broken down into three main sections:





Inside of After Effects -- This is where I will show you how to generate and export 3D camera tracking data for later use in 3DS Max.Inside 3DS Max -- From AE, we will get a camera the exactly matches the zoom angle and movement of our live video footage, but in Max we will have to adjust its scale and rotation in order to get it to match with the real world.  Once we have that, we can add any 3D elements we want to the footage.Bring It All Back Together In After Effects -- This is where we will do some compositing. The goal is to make the 3D animation elements and the live footage mesh together seamlessly and convincingly.





This course is hands on.  You will be following along with me creating a basic aerial fly-over.  You will learn the exact workflow that you need, plus a ton of tips and tricks that will help you to not get hung up when you graduate to your own projects.  I have already done all the troubleshooting for you, so learn from my experience. Check out the promo video to learn more about me, and about the project you will creating in the course.

198,2098232,4G LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - Concepts and call flows,"LTE (4G) is the first network technology that is capable of delivering high-speed data to subscribers. It is the most widely deployed 3GPP technology and its adoption has been the fastest compared to its predecessors (2G, 3G). 4G LTE lays the foundation for the future 5G networks. This course is designed to provide students with in-depth information regarding LTE EPC architecture. The course has been designed for all levels and starts off by providing the introduction to LTE and its advantages over legacy technologies. We then quickly start by building the foundation needed to understand the LTE technology and its architecture. During the lectures, all concepts are introduced by means of intuitive diagrams and real-network examples whenever possible.  Here are some of the reasons why this course is different compared to others - 1. Robust structureLTE EPC is a complex and very exhaustive topic. That is why we have organized the lectures in a way that students can quickly understand concepts.2. Intuitive Examples and Use Cases So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory. But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind LTE.3. Real network Examples In this course, we use real Wireshark traces from a test network to describe call flows rather than just relying on theory. This way we are able to deliver practical information to the students that will help them in real-world scenarios.4. 3GPP based material Throughout the course, we refer to the relevant 3GPP specifications so that students can become familiar with 3GPP specifications. 5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT  Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful LTE EPC course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help. No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. Therefore, feel free to send us a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Good Luck and Happy learning!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/4g-lte-evolved-packet-core-deep-dive-and-call-flows/,291,Network & Security,22,21,Suryabh S,"Laptop with Internet connectivity

Join more than 7,000 students learning about interesting research in psychology!



If you've ever wanted an easy way to start learning about psychology, this is the course for you!



In this free course, you'll learn about 5 studies in psychology and see how their results reveal interesting things about human thought and behavior.



The studies in this course reveal…



how we can persuade someone to do what we want without even providing good reasonswhy praising some kids for their intelligence vs. their hard word dramatically changed their test scoreswhy people who held a hot cup of coffee instead of an iced coffee automatically started thinking a stranger was especially generous and caring…and more!



Carefully designed experiments tell us a great deal about the choices we make, the ways we behave, and why we think the way we do. I'm a social psychologist myself, and I thought about which studies most interested me early in my education and which studies are my current favorites. I even reached out to my colleagues to ask them what studies have most inspired them and are important for everyone to know about.



So enroll in this fun introductory course and start seeing how simple research in psychology tells us amazing things about human thought and behavior!

Es un método maravilloso si es que necesitas desarrollar aplicaciones rápidas, sin tanta personalización.ADO.NET - Capa Conectada: Este mecanismo, nos permite ejecutar consultas a la base de datos directamente, con la advertencia de que tendremos que tener una conexión abierta para interactuar con la base de datos.ADO.NET - Capa Desconectada: Con este otro mecanismo, en lugar de tener una conexión abierta en todo momento, llenamos un objeto tipo DataSet, el cual contendrá una copia de la información que especifiquemos, para trabajar con dicha información fuera de línea, es decir, que no tendremos que estar conectados a la base de datos para utilizar la información.Dapper: Un simple, pero efectivo mapeador de objetos para .NET, con el cual, podremos consultar información de una tabla con tan sólo algunas líneas de código.Entity Framework: Un completo ORM (Mapeador de objetos relacionales) lanzado por Microsoft, la cual es una herramienta que simplifica el mapeo entre objetos a las tablas y columnas de una base de datos relacional.Sin duda, esta es una guía excelente, para aquellos que apenas inician con .Net y C#, o bien, para aquellos que ya tienen experiencia desarrollando con alguno de estas técnicas, pero desconoce completamente sobre los demás temas.¿Qué esperas para conectar tu aplicación a tu base de datos SQL Server?",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/conectar-c-sharp-a-sql-server/,463,Programming Languages,61,60,Héctor Uriel Pérez,"Nociones básicas de C#

217,1154438,50 Tools for the Ultimate Accelerated Learning Office,"(Make sure to read about the special 2-for-1 course bonus at the bottom of this description)

This course has a history...







In 2014 I published my second course (I now have over 50 available on Udemy). 







It was called 50 Learning Machines. 







It was my collection of all my favorite software tools for learning faster. 









As a bonus, I included about 15 of my favorite pieces of hardware that I use for learning.









It turned out that this hardware bonus was just as popular, if not more popular, with my students than the software, apps and plugins I recommended in the main body of the course.









Over the years I've added to my collection of hardware tools and developed this idea of building hte ultimate workbench for accelerated learners.









This course is the result of that 3 year mission. 









This time around all 50 machines are hardware tools, and I've even included some bonuses on top of the original 50 that cover some cutting edge technology that I think is worth taking a look at. 









This course has cost me over $10,000 in testing to create. I've tested tons of different items to come up with this final list. I've done lots of research on each category of tool to find the best in the category. I've optimized for price and performance. 









Along with the tools, I also share how I use them, which is just as valuable, if not more so, than the list of tools itself. 









You'll learn many strategies here that I don't teach in my other courses and am revealing here for the first time. 









The first edition of 50 Learning Machines was one of my best selling courses and great reviews. 









BONUS for a limited time:









As a bonus, every student that finishes this course to 100% will get free access to the original 50 learning machines course with all the original software, mobile apps and browser extensions completely free. 









See you on the inside.

Scroll below for the answer...Correct: 1.Correct option:AWS Storage GatewayAWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your existing on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud. Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving tape backups to the cloud, reducing on-premises storage with cloud-backed file shares, providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications, as well as various migration, archiving, processing, and disaster recovery use cases.AWS Storage Gateway service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access.Incorrect options:""AWS Direct Connect"" - AWS Direct Connect creates a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC. This is a private connection and does not use the public internet. Takes at least a month to establish this connection. Direct Connect is a connectivity service and you cannot use it to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""AWS Snowball"" - AWS Snowball is a data transport solution that accelerates moving terabytes to petabytes of data into and out of AWS services using storage devices designed to be secure for physical transport. You cannot use Snowball to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""Amazon EBS"" - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

Well, yes!







Why an hour? Because that's all you need as an experienced developer!







We'll see the basics constructs of the language - variables, conditionals, loops, strings and arrays. Being an experienced developer you probably don't need an explanation of ""what a loop is"" but you want to see how loop is done in Kotlin. This is my attitude through all this course - I won't waste your time in telling you things you already know. I'll try to show you new things and give you the direction to go on.







Developers: want a fast introduction to Kotlin? If you're familiar with Java, I can help you get up to speed in just a couple of of hours.







Kotlin is a fascinating new language that's attracted lots of attention, including from Google. In this short course you'll get to know Kotlin and its essentials. You'll be able to start writing code in no time. 









































If you are an experienced developer and heard the buzz about Kotlin - this course is for you.

























If you are a Java developer and want to dive into Kotlin, I'll help you translate your Java knowledge into Kotlin expertise in no time.

























If you are a Java developer and heard all those talking about Kotlin, but you don't know where to start - start here. Your java knowledge will be translated quickly into kotlin.





















In this course I'll show you the essentials of this young and amazing language. We'll work with the IntelliJ IDE but if you just want to taste the language without any downloads or installations - that's fine, I'll introduce the Kotlin Playground which is a great tool for writing and evaluating Kotlin on line without any configurations.





















We'll see how Kotlin's functions work, and how functional programming is done in Kotlin.





















We'll see how OOP is done in Kotlin and what are the main improvements over java.





















Finally, I'll give you some suggestions to what else can be done and which topics you might want to get interested in the Kotlin's ecosystem.





















Hope you choose to take this course and get to know Kotlin, a fascinating new language!

You’re in for a treat.  This is my favorite UX web design project for GIMP users!  You’ll learn something you didn’t know was possible… how to find out what font was used from a (flattened) JPG file!  Yep, I’ll show you where to upload your file and a computer will crunch it’s database of 100,000+ fonts and tell you which one was used!So far, most of our UX web design projects have had a modern, clean UX web design style applied to them.  Not this time.  We’re going all out on transforming a plain, boring site with a bold, fun retro web design style.  Oh, and we are still focusing on an awesome (UX) user experience with the overall web design.You’ll start off by creating a retro slider for the Hero section.  Then you’ll design an e-commerce like body section featuring old-movie posters.  Plus, I've added more pro UX (user experience) web design tips and useful tips for using GIMP!GIMP Web Design Project 7By now, you’ve learned just about all my UX web design tips.  Don’t despair.  I have a few more pro tips and GIMP tricks to share with you in this final UX web design project.Including, how to transform an ordinary, boring, plain, photo into a work-of-art; a Watercolor (in GIMP).  No worries.  No need to buy a canvas, brushes or watercolor paint.  I’ll show you how to do it all in GIMP!Once you’ve completed all 7 GIMP UX web design projects you’ll have mastered over a dozen keyboard shortcuts (that will help you design faster).  Plus, if you applied my suggestions and did the 7 web design assignments, you’ll have 7 UX web designs developed from YOUR creative vision to use in your portfolio.  All of which, can be submitted to our QA section for feedback or just to show off your new UX web design skills!Learn GIMP web design by doing!

By doing this, we will complete objectives 11, 12, 13 and parts of 6 and 18 from the 70-461 exam.Session 5We'll will now be creating aggregate queries, working through objective 9 of the exam 70-461. We'll be reviewing the ranking functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK and NTILE. We'll look at the 8 analytic functions news to SQL Server 2012, such as LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.We'll look at alternative ways of grouping and adding totals, using ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS and GROUPING_ID. If you want to take the 70-461 exam, we'll also look at the geometry and geography data types, plotting locations on a grid, together with functions and aggregates.Session 6We'll will now be creating sub-queries, working through objectives 7b-e of the exam 70-461. We'll be created correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We'll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we'll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.We'll be looking at functions (objective 14), including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We'll then complete objective 6 by looking at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and objective 8 by looking at the use of GUIDs. We'll also look at sequences. We'll have a look at XML. Finally, for SQL Server 2016 and later (exam 70-761), we'll examine JSON and Temporal Tables.Session 7In this session we'll be looking at transactions, seeing how to explicitly start and end them, and finding out how they can block other users in the database. Then we'll see about how to indexes and their role in optimising queries. We'll also see how we can use Dynamic Management Views to see how we can improve our use of indexes. We'll then look at how to write a cursor, and when to use this row-based operation, and the impact of using scalar UDFs.No prior knowledge is required - I'll even show you how to install SQL Server on your computer for free!There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.Once finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in T-SQL.

However, the information in this course is still relevant to DBA.Do you want to gain practical experience in Database Administration in SQLServer?Welcome.In this course, learn some of the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV or resume, and even go for the official Microsoft certification.SQLServer is one of the main database tools that is requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to do DBA for SQLServer could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.We'll download and install for free SQLServer Developer, which gives you all of the capabilities of the full-cost Enterprise edition (though without being able to use it for commercial purposes). We'll start by downloading a demonstration database, and learning how to backup and restore this database, and what recovery models are appropriate for other databases, to enable you to offer Point in Time recovery.We'll manage logins and server roles, so you can control who gets access to what data, implement and maintain indexes, so you can speed up searches, and import and export data. We'll look at managing SQLServer Agent, so you can automate routine tasks, and also be alerted to problems, we'll manage and configure databases, and look at compression, both of which aids with administrating big databases. And much more.The course will take around 10 hours to complete,but completing this will enable you to versed in Database Administration tasks, giving you hands-on experience.The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll manually backup a database, but then later we'll use SQLServer Agent to automate this. In this course, we will only do activities that require one computer, instead of multiple servers or virtualization.The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual DBA will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.No knowledge of T-SQLis required, as I'll demonstrate everything Ican through the GUI(Graphical User Interface) as well as T-SQL.

If this issue doesn't directly affect me, why should I care?



The truth is you don't know that no one in your life is transgender and there's a very good chance that if you've said anything remotely like the above to them, they might never feel safe enough to tell you. 



A Beginner's Guide to Trans 101 is the very basic foundation for developing cultural competence in working with transgender individuals. With the increased visibility of the transgender community more industries and individuals are finding the need to increase their knowledge and understanding of issues that effect the transgender community. 



It is important to learn appropriate and inappropriate ways to interact with members of the community so that your communication can be positive, non-stigmatizing and successful. And, well, just basically not be jerk.

Video lectures are great for learning concepts, but can be difficult to skim through later when you're trying to remember what you learned. Because of this, this course includes video lectures AND written articles. Nearly every video is accompanied with a written article so you can reinforce your learning, and have an easy way to skim through and study the tougher concepts.

From the educational side, it boosts people's understanding by simplifying many complex concepts. From the industry point of view, models are much easier to understand, maintain, and develop.Deep Learning is one of the fastest growing areas of Artificial Intelligence. In the past few years, we have proven that Deep Learning models, even the simplest ones, can solve very hard and complex tasks. Now, that the buzz-word period of Deep Learning has, partially, passed, people are releasing its power and potential for their product improvements.The course is structured in a way to cover all topics from neural network modeling and training to put it in production.In Part 1 of the course, you will learn about the technology stack that we will use throughout the course (Section 1) and the TensorFlow 2.0 library basics and syntax (Section 2).In Part 2 of the course, we will dig into the exciting world of deep learning. Through this part of the course, you will implement several types of neural networks (Fully Connected Neural Network (Section 3), Convolutional Neural Network (Section 4), Recurrent Neural Network (Section 5)). At the end of this part, Section 6, you will learn and build their own Transfer Learning application that achieves state of the art (SOTA) results on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.After passing the part 2 of the course and ultimately learning how to implement neural networks, in Part 3 of the course, you will learn how to make your own Stock Market trading bot using Reinforcement Learning, specifically Deep-Q Network.Part 4 is all about TensorFlow Extended (TFX). In this part of the course, you will learn how to work with data and create your own data pipelines for production. In Section 8 we will check if the dataset has any anomalies using the TensorFlow Data Validation library and after learn how to check a dataset for anomalies, in Section 9, we will make our own data preprocessing pipeline using the TensorFlow Transform library.In Section 10 of the course, you will learn and create your own Fashion API using the Flask Python library and a pre-trained model. Throughout this section, you will get a better picture of how to send a request to a model over the internet. However, at this stage, the architecture around the model is not scalable to millions of request. Enter the Section 11. In this section of the course, you will learn how to improve solution from the previous section by using the TensorFlow Serving library. In a very easy way, you will learn and create your own Image Classification API that can support millions of requests per day!These days it is becoming more and more popular to have a Deep Learning model inside an Android or iOS application, but neural networks require a lot of power and resources! That's where the TensorFlow Lite library comes into play. In Section 12 of the course, you will learn how to optimize and convert any neural network to be suitable for a mobile device.To conclude with the learning process and the Part 5 of the course, in Section 13 you will learn how to distribute the training of any Neural Network to multiple GPUs or even Servers using the TensorFlow 2.0 library.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-2/,785,Machine Learning,133,120,"Hadelin de Ponteves

278,4221858,A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro),"Deep learning is increasingly dominating technology and has major implications for society.From self-driving cars to medical diagnoses, from face recognition to deep fakes, and from language translation to music generation, deep learning is spreading like wildfire throughout all areas of modern technology.But deep learning is not only about super-fancy, cutting-edge, highly sophisticated applications. Deep learning is increasingly becoming a standard tool in machine-learning, data science, and statistics. Deep learning is used by small startups for data mining and dimension reduction, by governments for detecting tax evasion, and by scientists for detecting patterns in their research data.Deep learning is now used in most areas of technology, business, and entertainment. And it's becoming more important every year.How does deep learning work?Deep learning is built on a really simple principle: Take a super-simple algorithm (weighted sum and nonlinearity), and repeat it many many times until the result is an incredibly complex and sophisticated learned representation of the data.Is it really that simple?mmm OK, it's actually a tiny bit more complicated than that ;) but that's the core idea, and everything else -- literally everything else in deep learning -- is just clever ways of putting together these fundamental building blocks. That doesn't mean the deep neural networks are trivial to understand:there are important architectural differences between feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks.Given the diversity of deep learning model designs, parameters, and applications, you can only learn deep learning -- Imean, really learn deep learning, not just have superficial knowledge from a youtube video -- by having an experienced teacher guide you through the math, implementations, and reasoning. And of course, you need to have lots of hands-on examples and practice problems to work through. Deep learning is basically just applied math, and, as everyone knows, math is not a spectator sport!What is this course all about?Simply put:The purpose of this course is to provide a deep-dive into deep learning. You will gain flexible, fundamental, and lasting expertise on deep learning. You will have a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts in deep learning, so that you will be able to learn new topics and trends that emerge in the future.Please note:This is not a course for someone who wants a quick overview of deep learning with a few solved examples. Instead, this course is designed for people who really want to understand how and why deep learning works; when and how to select metaparameters like optimizers, normalizations, and learning rates; how to evaluate the performance of deep neural network models; and how to modify and adapt existing models to solve new problems.You can learn everything about deep learning in this course.In this course, you will learn Theory:Why are deep learning models built the way they are? Math:What are the formulas and mechanisms of deep learning?Implementation:How are deep learning models actually constructed in Python (using the PyTorch library)?Intuition: Why is this or that metaparameter the right choice? How to interpret the effects of regularization?etc.Python:If you're completely new to Python, go through the 8+ hour coding tutorial appendix. If you're already a knowledgeable coder, then you'll still learn some new tricks and code optimizations.Google-colab:Colab is an amazing online tool for running Python code, simulations, and heavy computations using Google's cloud services. No need to install anything on your computer.Unique aspects of this courseClear and comprehensible explanations of concepts in deep learning.Several distinct explanations of the same ideas, which is a proven technique for learning.Visualizations using graphs, numbers, and spaces that provide intuition of artificial neural networks.LOTSof exercises, projects, code-challenges, suggestions for exploring the code. You learn best by doing it yourself!Active QA forum where you can ask questions, get feedback, and contribute to the community.8+ hour Python tutorial. That means you don't need to master Python before enrolling in this course.So what are you waiting for??Watch the course introductory video and free sample videos to learn more about the contents of this course and about my teaching style.

286,1122334,A Practical Introduction to Cloud Computing,"The 2nd top hit for 'Cloud Computing' on Google says 'Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet.' Unfortunately, that definition is completely wrong.

This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.















And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.















I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.















Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listing the Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.















You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different models and then dive deep into the details and options of each. I also give lab demos of how to deploy each type.















The Cloud Deployment Models of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.















Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet to show you how to do a TCO cost comparison when choosing between an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.















A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivation to complete further training and be a real asset to their company.
















As a student in this course, you will get an answer to every question you ask in the Ask Question section. I love interaction with my students- anything you want to know, please ask.

















Thank you for taking the time to read about the course. I hope you now have enough motivation to get into the learning right away. If so, click the Enroll Now button at the top of the page to get started!

287,3531076,A Professional Introduction to Scrum,"Are you and your team exhausted and frustrated because you are juggling multiple projects and constantly task-switching? Does working this way make it difficult to understand progress or to feel a sense of purpose in your daily work? How often do you discover that what you delivered doesn't achieve desired outcomes? Does quality often get sacrificed under pressure to do more faster? If you are looking for a better way to approach complex work and deliver high value solutions, Scrum is the way. Scrum done well enables business agility, which is essential in our unpredictable and rapidly changing world. Scrum is a framework that helps people productively and creatively solve complex problems and deliver greater value. Scrum enables you to deliver Increments of value working in short cycles. This approach helps you incorporate learning as you do the work, get feedback frequently to make sure you are on the right track, and respond quickly to change.Icreated this Udemy course for you - filled with my unique insights as a licensed Professional Scrum Trainer, Steward of the Professional Scrum Master (PSM)curriculum, and owner of an agility training and coaching business. I have taught over 1,300 students on 5 continents. I am co-author of the book Mastering Professional Scrum, published in 2019 by Pearson Addison-Wesley. Iam also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and started my career working in traditional project management, which gives me a unique perspective to help people understand the difference and make the transition to Scrum and agility if it makes sense for them.Note:This course is up-to-date with the 2020 Scrum Guide.Scrum may have its roots in software, but it has been used well beyond software for decades. I designed the course to help you apply Scrum in any context - from operations to marketing, from projects and products to research and problem solving, and even running departments or entire organizations. Ioffer a wide range of examples to help you see how the concepts can be applied for different types of work.Student Review --""This was a phenomenal course. Stephanie's lectures were fun to watch, and it's clear she knows her material. She spoke at a cadence that was easy to follow, and you can tell she's into what she's teaching. I found her guides to be very helpful and highly recommend signing up for her newsletter. I look forward to taking more courses from Stephanie in the future.""This course is built to help you learn Scrum the right way - in alignment with the official Scrum Guide and leveraging the foundational values and principles. Zero previous Scrum experience is required. In fact, it is often beneficial to have zero experience because you won't have as much to unlearn. In my experience, there are many misunderstandings and myths about Scrum that prevent teams from applying Scrum well and gaining the benefits of agility. This course can also serve as a great refresher and validation of knowledge for people who do have Scrum experience but little to no professional Scrum training. In this course, you will learn to: Identify the key differences between a traditional plan-driven approach and an agile value-driven approachShift your mindset towards an agile way of thinkingDefine the roles, artifacts, and events of the Scrum framework, the importance of each one, and how they all fit together to maximize value deliveryLeverage empiricism and the Scrum values to navigate challenges and maximize the benefits of ScrumDetermine when to use ScrumDefine and meaure valueCreate and evolve a definition of ""Done""Break out of the mindset of focusing on tasks and deliverables and see opportunity to deliver value in entirely new waysRethink how you can iteratively and incrementally deliver valueApply the Goldilocks Principle to Product Backlog RefinementMake the minimal decisions needed to get started with ScrumEstimate and forecast using agile techniquesAvoid using velocity in the wrong waysLeverage an agile approach to managing budgets and schedulesApply my model for improving your Scrum implementation (because there are no best practices when dealing with complex work)Get additional resources to go deeper in your learningAgility is essential in today's environment. Agility is the real competitive advantage. Teams and organizations must be nimble, creative, and resilient in order to effectively navigate complexity and thrive in a constantly changing world. Scrum is used by over 12 million people around the world. While Scrum does have its origins in software development, it has been used well beyond software for decades as more and more teams and organizations have realized their work is complex and their environment is unpredictable and rapidly changing. I offer a wide range of examples to help people understand the concepts and how to apply in their own context.Throughout the course, you will have opportunities to reflect on questions that will help bring the course concepts to life in your own context. Ihave included two canvasesIuse with my coaching clients that will help you start applying Scrum in your work environment. And for those of you who are eager to take your learning deeper, I'll guide you toward next steps.This course is different because it is true to the Scrum Guide and Ken Schwaber's vision, and it is not prescriptive. Agile is not a silver bullet. Scrum is a framework - not a methodology - that leverages the power of a small, self-organizing team. The Scrum Team decides their process within the framework, and that process will evolve as they inspect and adapt, learn and grow. There are no best practices in Scrum because we are dealing with complexity. Best practices only exist in simple environments. A lot of the information you find online and even what is delivered in training does not clarify what is required by Scrum versus what is an example or personal opinion. I aim to teach you the foundational knowledge you need to effectively navigate in your own context. Iprovide examples of helpful practices and advice from my own experience, however, Imake clear distinctions and help you understand why you might use a practice and the benefits it can provide.When applied with discipline and intention, Scrum helps you confidently navigate complexity and uncertainty, deliver greater value, and thrive in a constantly changing world.Are you in for that?Enroll today and begin your Scrum journey with me!(Trust a former project manager and perfectionist...
