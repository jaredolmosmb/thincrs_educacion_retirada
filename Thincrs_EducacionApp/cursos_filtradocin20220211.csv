Es difícil de creer a primera vista, pero son nuestros miedos, limitaciones y creencias limitantes respecto a nosotros mismos y al mundo que nos rodean que nos impiden realizar las actividades que sabemos que tenemos que hacer para obtener los resultados que queremos alcanzar.En este curso, nos enfocaremos justamente en reconocer en primera instancia, que es realmente la procrastinación, de tal manera que logremos identificar cuáles son los factores personales que nos están llevando a procrastinar y a dejar de lado lo que consideramos importante para nuestra vida.Teniendo esto claro, nos enfocaremos en crear hábitos que nos permita culminar nuestras tareas más fácilmente y ser más productivos en cada una de las áreas de nuestra vida en las cuales nos hemos fijado una meta concreta.Este curso ha sido creado de un procrastinador para los procrastinadores, de tal manera que no se convierta en un curso que repite libros de texto y de autoayuda, que ofrecen técnicas exprés que a largo plazo no tienen utilidad.Este curso es para aquellas personas comprometidas en crear un cambio contundente y radical en su vida, eliminando aquellos hábitos que no les permiten avanzar en su vida y crear aquellos que los lleven mucho más lejos de las metas que se han propuesto.Si estás dispuesto a trabajar en ti, ¡Bienvenido al curso!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/destruye-la-procrastinacion/,366,Secundaria Desarrollo Personal Personal Growth,69,64,David Bejarano,"Tener dificultades para comenzar ciertas actividades, tareas, procesos o metas.

Are your interviews failing to produce enough reliable information to pick consistent ‘winners’? Are you missing out on the best candidates, often losing them to the competition?Whether you’re a seasoned HR professional or an entry-level recruiter, job market insider and hiring strategist Ryan Lecour shares his refreshing blueprint to guide you through the interviewing and hiring process with a step-by-step method that secures the best fit every time.The interview is the only window you have for observing candidates. Business-building and team-transforming decisions are based on these limited and precious hours. Many take credit for the quote ‘a company is only as good as its people'. Truer words cannot be said. And the interview is ground zero for determining how good your company is going to be.In this course, Ryan teaches invaluable foundations on interview planning  execution. Students will learn essential strategies for question building, test administration and candidate evaluation. They’ll also learn key tactics for achieving clarity and verification with candidate profiles, personalities and work history. The course upholds a constant respect for the crucial role the interview plays in determining the fate of companies in areas of team-building and employee selection.Learn to hire consistent winners with proven interview techniques from a leading recruiting strategistThe following are some of the key things you will learn how to do in this course:Cut to the heart of the truth with penetrating sequences of probing questions that reveal critical details surrounding the candidate’s career change historyIdentify the elements of strong and weak candidate questions and learn to evaluate how they contribute to the overall strength of the candidacyBring awareness to unconscious biases that tend to creep into the process and mitigate or eliminate their effect while restoring objectivity and sound evaluationLead the stakeholder synchronization meeting with an organized method that efficiently captures the various dimensions of the position and sets the table for the interview planEstablish preemptive compensation discussions early in the interview process and setup foundations for favorable offer negotiationsBuild an interview kit that guides the interview and ensures the best use of time for all personnel involved in the processRyan draws on nearly a decade of experience witnessing how the interview has the power and influence to ‘make or break’ companies. From supplying key personnel to the offices of Apple, Google and many other Fortune 100 companies, to starting and operating his own successful HR firm, Ryan has learned that decisions on matters of hiring are difficult and almost always based on incomplete information.

In version 6 of the course, you have access to a brand new series of animations that make full use of Udemy's new assignments feature and a new section on designing a longer-term career plan.Udemy's Assignments enable you to receive guided instructions, use your skills, and then see how your instructor does something. We've leveraged this feature by taking the most challenging parts of the Career Hacking™ course and making them easier for you through the use of these guided assignments. For example, when you reach the point in the course where you need to develop bulletpoints for your resume / CV, you'll find an animated Assignment that takes you through the process step-by-step, gives you a chance to develop your own resume bulletpoint using what you've learned in the course, and then shows you how it's done by your instructor.Many of you have also asked for help developing a mid and long-term career plan. In version 6, we've added an additional section to help you. First, you'll learn soft skills that will help you transition to working with a new team and/or at a new job. Then you will have the opportunity to use the VISTA career planning tool that we've built for you so that you can align your values, interests, skills, and more with your career goals.One of the new videos that we've added for you is an interview with Stephen Szermer, someone who successfully completed a big mid-life career change. His story will help anyone who is in a career rut, needs to change careers, or feels like the world has evolved past their existing skill set. We hope you enjoy Career Hacking™ version 6!January 7th, 2019: What's new in version 6.1?We've migrated some of the guides and course tools to Google Drive so that they're usable across all of your devices and easier to use than .pdfs!April 9th, 2019: What's new in version 6.2?You all are amazing! We want to harness the collective power of the Career Hacking™ community to make the course better for you and other future students, so we've added the ability for you to contribute your ideas related to new content and course features through a simple, anonymous feedback mechanism. Thanks for working with us to make your learning experience awesome!June 21st, 2019:What's new in version 6.3? We've just made a HUGEupgrade to your course. Specifically, we:Remastered all videos in the course. We realize that, over the years, we exported videos with varying volume levels. This was causing some of you to have to frequently adjust the volume settings on your playback devices, so Davis spent time remastering the volume across the entire Career Hacking™ learning experience. We've heard many of you ask for additional support with mid and later-life career changes, so Davis spent quite a lot of time creating a comprehensive presentation specifically tailored to the needs of people going through a mid or later-life career change. You can find this presentation in the text lecture where all of the course resources are listed and in a special optional lecture in the career strategy section of the course.The LinkedIn® PowerGame is now a fundamental part of your learning experience.Previously, it was an optional video. We did this because being able to engage in professional networking on LinkedIn® is increasingly important for many careers.Davis migrated two videos that were previously presented in-stream in the course to optional videos. The first video that has been converted to optional viewing is one on tips for people going into a coding interview and the second is for CareerHackers looking to get a USVisa. Because these are specialized scenarios, we want to make sure that they're taken by those who need them, not everyone who participates in Career Hacking™. November 1, 2019:What's new in version 6.4?You've asked and we've delivered!Career Hacking™ is now fully closed captioned in English so that you can clearly understand key CareerHacking™ concepts and so that students whose first language isn't English can have a fuller learning experience and develop their English skills while taking the course!We're introducing a suite of Voices from the Field lectures.This lecture style is something that Davis learned while participating in Harvard's Leaders of Learning program. In each lecture, we pose an important career management question to experts with a variety of professional expertise and backgrounds so that you can get multiple informed viewpoints on these topics. In this update, we feature experts with experience in technical recruiting, in placing candidates looking for work after receiving professional certificates, in helping MBAgraduates get jobs, in coaching executives in Silicon Valley, and in breaking into the financial services sector. Thanks for joining us in the Career Hacking™ course!January 4, 2020:What's new in version 6.5?When you're searching for a job, keeping records of your applications and managing your professional network are super important. Previously, we showed you how to take care of these problems using Podio® as your ""Job Search CRM"" platform. However, Podio® is really designed to be used by teams for much more complex activities, so Davis Jones, this course's designer, built a custom tool for Career Hacking™ participants that's built on top of Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. It's called the Career Hacking™ Hub. This free software keeps all of your information private (essentially, it's a modified Google Sheet that you own), and it pairs perfectly with what you learn in your Career Hacking™ learning experience. You should find this tool convenient, free, and helpful. You can learn more about it inside the course. We're always trying to add value for you and to support your success!Welcome to Career Hacking™ 6.5.January 14, 2020: What's new in version 6.5.1?Your fellow Career Hacker David Williamson contributed a valuable new career hack related to uncovering small and medium-sized businesses who don't often advertise higher-level positions publicly. It's been added in the description of the ""Hidden Job Market""module. Thanks David!March 13th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.2?You'll find a new SideBySide that walks you through using the new Career Hacking™ Hub App. This should enable you to get up and running with the newest technology feature of the Career Hacking™ course quickly!April 20th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.3?We've started responding to the Coronavirus pandemic by adding additional resources to yourCareer Hacking™ experience.July 30th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.4?After auditing CareerHacking™, we found that some of the course's resources were difficult for mobile users to access. So, we've upgraded the way we saved and uploaded your Career Hacking™ resources, and also added multiple cloud-based (Google Drive)resources.This should make it easier for you to take your CareerHacking™ on mobile devices, and in situations when your access to broadband may be limited.November 2020:What's new in version 6.6?Wow. There are a BUNCHof new updates to your Career Hacking™ course!You have a completely rebuilt resume-writing section. Specifically, your course has transitioned to building your resume in Google Docs by default. This has a number of benefits for you:Your resume is now mobile-friendly. This is increasingly important, because your career conversations are now taking place, in the earliest stages at least, via messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp®, LinkedIn® messenger, Twitter®, DMs, etc.). In those situations, the person on the other end of your message is most likely on a mobile device. Now, when you send them your resume, it will open to a perfectly-formatted, mobile-friendly version.ALL of the Career Hackers in this course will now be able to create best-in-class resumes using the templates provided--whether you have access to Microsoft Word® (a paid software program) or not. Transitioning to Google Docs® makes your Career Hacking™ course more diverse and inclusive for our global Career Hacking™ community.You'll now be able to short link to your resume. This will make it easier for you to share your resume, and you'll look like the tech-savvy person you are when you do it.You'll still be able to export your resume to traditional formats (like PDF and .doc).Important note: You can ABSOLUTELY still use Microsoft Word to build your resume. The course fully supports Microsoft Word®, Pages (Mac), and other word processing softwares.You have a completely rebuilt LinkedIn® section. In recent years, LinkedIn® has made a number of important updates to the layout of the platform, how features are arranged, and how media is presented. So, your new Career Hacking™ course has brand new, fresh tutorials to enable you to take advantage of the Platform's most important tools and features.New content on pre-interviewing and digital messaging. According to our network of labor market experts, an increasing number of career relationships are starting with informal message swaps. For example, you may connect with a recruiter on LinkedIn® and then immediately exchange a few career-related messages with them. Your new Career Hacking™ course embraces this new reality, and equips you with the tools to succeed in these message exchanges. This part of the recruiting process, which we call ""pre-interviewing"", is now covered in the Course.Increased support for remote workers and applying for remote opportunities. An increasing number of roles are remote or partially remote, and these opportunities appeal to many Career Hackers. So, we've integrated a number of changes to your resume-writing, networking, and LinkedIn® profile design approaches that enable you to increase your ability to succeed in the distributed work environment.We've added new Voices from the Field and interview lectures.We've updated your LinkedIn® and resume writing guides, with brand new content that aligns with changes to the respective platforms, approaches, and wording practices involved in creating a stand-out professional profile. Enjoy the updates!November 2020:What's new in version 6.6.1?Your course has a bunch of fresh new links.

Specifically, we've added a new ""Voices from the Field"" lecture where you'll meet a wide variety of professionals who share how they'd like to be approached on LinkedIn® for new networking opportunities. We've also invested in new content for you around the legality of using images sourced from previous employers or partners on your LinkedIn® profile--an area of content for which we have received a number of requests.We've added additional resources for those of you looking to transition into technology roles.We've upgraded many of your tools around using LinkedIn® for networking and for ""pre-interviewing"", because we're seeing an increasing amount of job search activity happening on LinkedIn®.Enjoy the updates!!January 2022:What's new in version 6.7.1?In this update, we've added professionally-developed English-language subtitles to all of the new lectures that were published in the recent upgrade.

You’ve got all the strategies you need in this growth hacking course.   In the first part of the course, you’ll gain essential “big picture” skills, including developing your customer personas, interviewing your target markets, and analyzing your “buyer center” (i.e. the individuals in your target market with the most purchasing power).   Next, you’ll learn how to analyze your results. With any growth hacking effort, you always want to know what’s working, where it’s working, and what needs to be changed. For this, you need digital marketing tools like web traffic analysis and lean analytics.  Lastly, you’ll discover highly effective tools to bring boatloads of new customers – ones with money to spend – into your online eco-system. This includes the concepts of digital conversion funnels, lifetime customer value (LTV), and customer acquisition costs (CAC). 

 Develop a User-Centric Approach to Digital Marketing You’ll start by learning what growth hacking is and then move on to building your digital analytics skills.We'll take your Google Analytics skills to the next level by teaching you how to use these advanced tools with real data from the Google Merchandise Store. Then, you'll learn how to develop marketing personas and user segments--using online research methods (like Facebook Audience Insights) and the person-to-person interviewing methods used by companies like IDEOand Apple in Silicon Valley. Then, you'll learn how to work with Pirate Metrics and marketing funnels so that you can guide potential customers through each step... from awareness to revenue to referrals.In the second half of the course, you’ll discover how to create digital marketing materials that target the unique wants and needs of your customer. This might seem like a given, right? In fact, it’s a much rarer skill than you might think, and absolutely crucial for maximizing sales. No growth hacking course is complete without this must-know info! Then you’ll get a crash course in both online SEO and in content marketing, allowing you create relevant and memorable content that’s designed to be discoverable on the web. The email marketing section will introduce you to automated strategies for email. You’ll also develop the ability to use email platforms to manage your subscriber lists.In the later parts of the course, you'll learn how to estimate and use both LifetimeCustomerValue (LTV)and Customer AcquisitionCosts (CAC)--two critical metrics for building a digital marketing engine. The course wraps up with a section on paid acquisition(like PPC Ads andsocial media ads) so that you can bring traffic into the ""top of your funnel"" on-demand.Also, this is version 7 of this course!

PRACTICAL TRAINING WITH REAL SPATIAL DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















DEVELOP MAD GIS SKILLS AND PERFORM SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS USING FREE KICKASS TOOLS SUCH AS QGIS, R, GRASS AND GOOGLE EARTH. 

















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















This course is designed to take users who use R and QGIS for basic spatial data/GIS analysis to perform more advanced GIS tasks (including automated workflows and geo-referencing) using a variety of different data. In addition to making you proficient in R and QGIS for spatial data analysis, you will be introduced to another powerful free GIS software.. GRASS.

















This course takes a completely practical approach to spatial data analysis and mapping- Each lecture will teach you a practical application/processing technique which you can apply easily.

















The course is taught by Minerva Singh, A PhD graduate from Cambridge University, UK, who has several years of research experience in Quantitative Ecology and an MPhil in Geography and Environment from Oxford University. Minerva has published papers in international peer reviewed journals and given talks at international conferences.  

















The underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can put spatial data analysis into practice today and develop sound GIS analysis skills. You’ll be able to start analyzing spatial data for your own projects, and IMPRESS YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYERS with examples of your PRACTICAL spatial data analysis abilities. This course is different from other training resources. Each lecture seeks to enhance your GIS skills in a demonstrable and tangible manner and provide you with practically implementable GIS solutions.

















This is an intermediate course in spatial data analysis, i.e. we will build on on basic spatial data analysis tasks (such as those covered in the beginner version course: Core Spatial Data Analysis: Introductory GIS with R and QGIS) and teach users how to practically implement more complex GIS tasks such as interpolation, mapping spatial data, geo-referencing and detailed vector processing. Additionally you will be introduced to preliminary geo-statistics and mapping/visualizing spatial data. 

















This course covers complex GIS techniques, and by completing this course, you will be implementing these PRACTICALLY in freely-available software, thus making you MORE ATTRACTIVE TO EMPLOYERS.  

















It is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend a tiny amount of time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts pertaining to the different spatial data analysis techniques demonstrated in the course. However, majority of the course will focus on working with real spatial data from different sources. After each video you will learn how to practically implement a new concept or technique in the different softwares used for the course.

















During the course of my research I have discovered that R is a powerful tool for collating and analyzing spatial data acquired from different sources.  Proficiency in spatial data analysis in R and QGIS has helped me publish more peer reviewed papers faster. Feel free to check out my profile on ResearchGate.

















FREE BONUS: You will have access to all the data used in the course, along with the R code files. You will also have access to future lectures, resources and R code files. Enroll in the course today  take advantage of this special bonus!

















I don’t have to remind you that we have a RISK-FREE GUARANTEE in the case of you not being satisfied with the course. Take action now!

87,3491366,*NEW* Advanced Forms - 2022 Build & Master Web forms,"THENITTYGRITTYOFWEBFORMS?A web form is also known as an HTML form. It’s a place where users can enter data that’s then sent to a server for processing. Web forms allow users to place orders on your site, to provide their name and email address to sign up for a newsletter, or to sign up as a member to your site and so forth.What’s really great about web forms is that there is no “one size fits all”. You can use your artistic flare, and personal business acumen to create web forms with a particular length, format, content type and appearance.By doing this course, you’ll be able to improve your web form usability, which will ultimately enhance user experience and get website visitors excited about completing your form and converting.Why is this course so important?Forms which are on point present an opportunity for a company to grow and capture loyalty.A form can often be both a marketing tool and a necessity. A form that puts the user at ease, that evokes feelings of trust, will get filled out far more often than a form which looks (or is) complicated and confusing. After completing my “Advanced Forms” course, you will be knowledgeable, confident and the “go-to” person for forms.Let me share my form building skills with youUnderstanding how forms work will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master forms and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering a perfect, interactive and functional form is challenging. In this course, I take a deep-dive into explaining web forms and how they work. Why do we need to wrap our form within form tags? How can you include a progress bar in a form? How can you customize a toggle or checkbox? Where does the data go once a user clicks on the submit button? How can you perform validation on your form? How can a user upload a file? What happens once the data arrives at the server? What are the different types of events we can listen to on forms? By understanding these questions, and many more in the course, you will be able to build advanced forms and better yet, understand the full stack process! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic forms that improve user engagement and experience.WHATTHISCOURSECOVERSThis course is huge and comprehensive, from basics to advancedThis course will give you solid fundamentals and practicals regarding forms. It can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from this course with an advanced understanding and practical experience with building forms. It will take you to the point where you will understand what method (GET or POST) to use when sending form data, how to define where the data goes, how to perform advanced client-side validation (checking errors on the form before it is sent to the server), how to write custom pattern validation rules (using regular expressions), how to run servers and how to view all HTTP request information. This is awesome knowledge. This course will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end form web development.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” FORMS by gaining an understanding of how you can build it, manipulate it and style it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Why should you learn so much about forms?A web form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a relationship with them. The time you spend in bringing the user to your website should be matched with the time spent in perfecting the user experience with your web forms. It is surprising to see so many sites these days contain complex and frustrating web forms that cause a negative experience.Ultimately, a web form allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalogue request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database.Can you begin to see how important forms are and how their use can be escalated?*** A comprehensive FORMScourse on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how HTML code works behind the scenes. This is particularly true when it comes to building forms. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know, really know, how forms work. You need to understand how the browser URL encodes form data, how the browser sends data to a URL that you specify, and how to perform validation to ensure the user does not submit invalid data.A unique approachYou will learn ""why"" things work and not just ""how"". Understanding advanced topics about forms (lURL encoding, accept-charset, multipart/form-data, regex, etc) is important as it will give you infinite possibilities and upskill you. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create forms that are tailored to your needs, and allow the form data to get submitted to a server via AJAX. You will be able to create forms that are customizable by the user (for example, if the user wants to change the color of the form theme). You can create a control on a form that displays the progress completion of the form and displays messages to the user along the way.Can you begin to see how pivotal forms are and how important having knowledge about forms is?How is this course different?There are lots of courses that focus on web development. Many never get into the detail about how HTML forms work behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master in order to utilize potential.In this course, I focus on the more advanced topics of true web development when it comes to forms. This includes understanding what all of the attributes on the form element mean, understanding the different input types in detail, what URL encoding is, and how data is sent over the wire to a server.Practice makes perfectTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.I love practical examples, which is why we build multiple forms in this course, starting in section 1.Is this course for you?Absolutely. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:Student #1: You want to advance in the world of programming.Student #2: You want to know how successful developers build dynamic forms that engage with the user, have high conversions that put them ahead of the competition.Student #3: You want to gain a solid understanding of how forms really workStudent #4: You want to start using backend technologies like Node or PHP with formsWHY START NOW?Right this second, your competitors are learning how to become better web developers.Web development is a blazing hot topic at the moment, and in the foreseeable future. But you have a distinct advantage. This course offers memorable learning topics, actionable tactics and real-world examples.Lets get started!What do you get?Lifetime access to all tutorial videos. No fees or monthly subscriptions.QA support.Quizzes, coding challenges, a test and assignments to help you learn.I’ve allowed you to download all of my lectures for offline viewing.Let's get excited about becoming a professional web developer, and to be able to confidently apply it to your own websites.See you in the lectures.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/master-web-forms/,1301,Web Development,245,217,Clyde Matthew,"A desire to become an informed full stack web developer

88,2696476,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 1,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youUnderstanding the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. How exactly does the browser model your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Where can we access this model? What can we do with this model? How can we change this model? By understanding these questions, you will be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 1 of 2This course is the first course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do Course 2) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 1 with a basic understanding and practical experience. It will take you to the point where you will understand what the DOM is, why we need it, how to access it, where to find it and how to manipulate it. This is awesome knowledge. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development.In this course you’ll learn about front-end Web Development, by mastering the Document Object Model.Why do you need to know about the DOM?So, you know some HTML, you’ve created your first tags, learned about CSS, made awesome forms, star-gazing buttons, responsive pages and have started to create dynamic and interesting pages.But now you want to do more: “How can I add animation (and life) to my page? I wish I could give an error message to a user who incorrectly submits a form!”And this is where the DOM comes into the picture. and where this course(s) provide you with an opportunity to grow in your skills.To cut a long story short, we use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.The first step in understanding the DOM is understanding what it is. How does it differ from your HTML markup? How does it differ from JavaScript? From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to access the DOM. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to access and traverse the DOM. We don’t stop here, but then get into more advanced things like manipulating the DOM (via the create and remove methods given to us by the DOM API).Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” DOM by gaining an understanding of where you can find it, how you can access it, and more importantly, how you can manipulate it. We dig deeper in every lecture, learning about things like Nodes, the difference between HTTPCollections vs NodeLists, and a whole bunch more! This course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new remove API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** A must-do Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how your browser represents your HTML code and works behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to deal with the DOM. You need to know how to access it, how to manipulate it, and how to dynamically interact with it.I want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.I want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.This course is perfect for you.DescriptionHi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to learn how successful web developers can create whizbang websites that are dynamic and engaging!The root to understanding how to be a professional front-end web developer is understanding the Document Object Model and applying it to practical situations. We're going to practice and learn and emerge confident to tackle any challenges modern programs and websites throw at us.After completing a few university degrees, and post graduate studies, I developed a fascination for web design and software languages. For several years I have immersed myself in this. I spent a fair bit on top courses and went on to apply the knowledge practically. I recognized gaps in some of the courses I’ve taken and hence my course teaches what I wish I was taught. My intention is to share the knowledge with you in an easy to follow manner, so that we can benefit together.

Understanding the fundamentals of the DOM is important as it will give you infinite possibilities. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. You will be able to create apps that are customizable by the user. You can even allow the user to drag, move, and delete elements. Can you begin to see how important the DOM is?How is this course different?There are lots of great courses that focus on web development. Pity they never get into the detail about how the Document Object Model works behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master.In this course, I focus on true web development in the front end. This includes understanding what nodes are, looking at the Document node (this is different from the document object by the way), understanding the DOM tree structure, what the different types of nodes there are, and how you can use the DOM to access elements on your page and manipulate them.Practice makes perfectTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.I love practical examples, which is why we build simple pages and analyze the DOM together.Is this course for you?Absolutely.It doesn't matter where you are in your web development journey. It's suitable for all levels.Still unsure? If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:Student #1: You want to dabble in the world of programming.

89,2733254,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 2,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youMastering the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end web programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. In this advanced course, we take a deep-dive into DOM events. What are they? Why are they important? The different types of events we can listen to? Where do they come from? What is event bubbling and event capturing, and how does it help? By understanding these questions, and more, you'll be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 2 of 2This course is the second and final course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do both courses) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 2 with a solid understanding and practical experience of working with events in the DOM. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development. In this course you’ll learn more about front-end web development, by working with events in the Document Object Model.Why this course?Why do you need to know about events in the DOM?If you've ever wondered how you can add animation (and life) to a page, then you need to understand how events work in the DOM. We use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.This course starts off with understanding what an event is. What are the 2 most important things when it comes to events? What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler? From there, you’ll start exploring the different ways you can add events to your code. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to ‘listen’ for events on your web page and then interact with the page when those events happen. We don’t stop here, but get into more advanced things like learning about how an event travels in the DOM (capturing vs bubbling), which leads us to an even more important topic of ... wait for it ... event delegation. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We go into many other things like DOM extensions, object hierarchy and a bunch of other stuff.Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” DOM by gaining an understanding of how you can manipulate it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new classList API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** An advanced Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how events work on your website behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to work with various events in the DOM. You need to know what an event is, how to listen for it, and more importantly, how to react to events when they happen.I want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.I want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.This course is perfect for you.DescriptionHi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to learn how successful web developers can create whizbang websites that are dynamic and engaging!The root to understanding how to be a professional front-end web developer is understanding the Document Object Model and applying it to practical situations.
