Es difícil de creer a primera vista, pero son nuestros miedos, limitaciones y creencias limitantes respecto a nosotros mismos y al mundo que nos rodean que nos impiden realizar las actividades que sabemos que tenemos que hacer para obtener los resultados que queremos alcanzar.En este curso, nos enfocaremos justamente en reconocer en primera instancia, que es realmente la procrastinación, de tal manera que logremos identificar cuáles son los factores personales que nos están llevando a procrastinar y a dejar de lado lo que consideramos importante para nuestra vida.Teniendo esto claro, nos enfocaremos en crear hábitos que nos permita culminar nuestras tareas más fácilmente y ser más productivos en cada una de las áreas de nuestra vida en las cuales nos hemos fijado una meta concreta.Este curso ha sido creado de un procrastinador para los procrastinadores, de tal manera que no se convierta en un curso que repite libros de texto y de autoayuda, que ofrecen técnicas exprés que a largo plazo no tienen utilidad.Este curso es para aquellas personas comprometidas en crear un cambio contundente y radical en su vida, eliminando aquellos hábitos que no les permiten avanzar en su vida y crear aquellos que los lleven mucho más lejos de las metas que se han propuesto.Si estás dispuesto a trabajar en ti, ¡Bienvenido al curso!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/destruye-la-procrastinacion/,366,Secundaria Desarrollo Personal Personal Growth,69,64,David Bejarano,"Tener dificultades para comenzar ciertas actividades, tareas, procesos o metas.

Are your interviews failing to produce enough reliable information to pick consistent ‘winners’? Are you missing out on the best candidates, often losing them to the competition?Whether you’re a seasoned HR professional or an entry-level recruiter, job market insider and hiring strategist Ryan Lecour shares his refreshing blueprint to guide you through the interviewing and hiring process with a step-by-step method that secures the best fit every time.The interview is the only window you have for observing candidates. Business-building and team-transforming decisions are based on these limited and precious hours. Many take credit for the quote ‘a company is only as good as its people'. Truer words cannot be said. And the interview is ground zero for determining how good your company is going to be.In this course, Ryan teaches invaluable foundations on interview planning  execution. Students will learn essential strategies for question building, test administration and candidate evaluation. They’ll also learn key tactics for achieving clarity and verification with candidate profiles, personalities and work history. The course upholds a constant respect for the crucial role the interview plays in determining the fate of companies in areas of team-building and employee selection.Learn to hire consistent winners with proven interview techniques from a leading recruiting strategistThe following are some of the key things you will learn how to do in this course:Cut to the heart of the truth with penetrating sequences of probing questions that reveal critical details surrounding the candidate’s career change historyIdentify the elements of strong and weak candidate questions and learn to evaluate how they contribute to the overall strength of the candidacyBring awareness to unconscious biases that tend to creep into the process and mitigate or eliminate their effect while restoring objectivity and sound evaluationLead the stakeholder synchronization meeting with an organized method that efficiently captures the various dimensions of the position and sets the table for the interview planEstablish preemptive compensation discussions early in the interview process and setup foundations for favorable offer negotiationsBuild an interview kit that guides the interview and ensures the best use of time for all personnel involved in the processRyan draws on nearly a decade of experience witnessing how the interview has the power and influence to ‘make or break’ companies. From supplying key personnel to the offices of Apple, Google and many other Fortune 100 companies, to starting and operating his own successful HR firm, Ryan has learned that decisions on matters of hiring are difficult and almost always based on incomplete information.

In version 6 of the course, you have access to a brand new series of animations that make full use of Udemy's new assignments feature and a new section on designing a longer-term career plan.Udemy's Assignments enable you to receive guided instructions, use your skills, and then see how your instructor does something. We've leveraged this feature by taking the most challenging parts of the Career Hacking™ course and making them easier for you through the use of these guided assignments. For example, when you reach the point in the course where you need to develop bulletpoints for your resume / CV, you'll find an animated Assignment that takes you through the process step-by-step, gives you a chance to develop your own resume bulletpoint using what you've learned in the course, and then shows you how it's done by your instructor.Many of you have also asked for help developing a mid and long-term career plan. In version 6, we've added an additional section to help you. First, you'll learn soft skills that will help you transition to working with a new team and/or at a new job. Then you will have the opportunity to use the VISTA career planning tool that we've built for you so that you can align your values, interests, skills, and more with your career goals.One of the new videos that we've added for you is an interview with Stephen Szermer, someone who successfully completed a big mid-life career change. His story will help anyone who is in a career rut, needs to change careers, or feels like the world has evolved past their existing skill set. We hope you enjoy Career Hacking™ version 6!January 7th, 2019: What's new in version 6.1?We've migrated some of the guides and course tools to Google Drive so that they're usable across all of your devices and easier to use than .pdfs!April 9th, 2019: What's new in version 6.2?You all are amazing! We want to harness the collective power of the Career Hacking™ community to make the course better for you and other future students, so we've added the ability for you to contribute your ideas related to new content and course features through a simple, anonymous feedback mechanism. Thanks for working with us to make your learning experience awesome!June 21st, 2019:What's new in version 6.3? We've just made a HUGEupgrade to your course. Specifically, we:Remastered all videos in the course. We realize that, over the years, we exported videos with varying volume levels. This was causing some of you to have to frequently adjust the volume settings on your playback devices, so Davis spent time remastering the volume across the entire Career Hacking™ learning experience. We've heard many of you ask for additional support with mid and later-life career changes, so Davis spent quite a lot of time creating a comprehensive presentation specifically tailored to the needs of people going through a mid or later-life career change. You can find this presentation in the text lecture where all of the course resources are listed and in a special optional lecture in the career strategy section of the course.The LinkedIn® PowerGame is now a fundamental part of your learning experience.Previously, it was an optional video. We did this because being able to engage in professional networking on LinkedIn® is increasingly important for many careers.Davis migrated two videos that were previously presented in-stream in the course to optional videos. The first video that has been converted to optional viewing is one on tips for people going into a coding interview and the second is for CareerHackers looking to get a USVisa. Because these are specialized scenarios, we want to make sure that they're taken by those who need them, not everyone who participates in Career Hacking™. November 1, 2019:What's new in version 6.4?You've asked and we've delivered!Career Hacking™ is now fully closed captioned in English so that you can clearly understand key CareerHacking™ concepts and so that students whose first language isn't English can have a fuller learning experience and develop their English skills while taking the course!We're introducing a suite of Voices from the Field lectures.This lecture style is something that Davis learned while participating in Harvard's Leaders of Learning program. In each lecture, we pose an important career management question to experts with a variety of professional expertise and backgrounds so that you can get multiple informed viewpoints on these topics. In this update, we feature experts with experience in technical recruiting, in placing candidates looking for work after receiving professional certificates, in helping MBAgraduates get jobs, in coaching executives in Silicon Valley, and in breaking into the financial services sector. Thanks for joining us in the Career Hacking™ course!January 4, 2020:What's new in version 6.5?When you're searching for a job, keeping records of your applications and managing your professional network are super important. Previously, we showed you how to take care of these problems using Podio® as your ""Job Search CRM"" platform. However, Podio® is really designed to be used by teams for much more complex activities, so Davis Jones, this course's designer, built a custom tool for Career Hacking™ participants that's built on top of Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. It's called the Career Hacking™ Hub. This free software keeps all of your information private (essentially, it's a modified Google Sheet that you own), and it pairs perfectly with what you learn in your Career Hacking™ learning experience. You should find this tool convenient, free, and helpful. You can learn more about it inside the course. We're always trying to add value for you and to support your success!Welcome to Career Hacking™ 6.5.January 14, 2020: What's new in version 6.5.1?Your fellow Career Hacker David Williamson contributed a valuable new career hack related to uncovering small and medium-sized businesses who don't often advertise higher-level positions publicly. It's been added in the description of the ""Hidden Job Market""module. Thanks David!March 13th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.2?You'll find a new SideBySide that walks you through using the new Career Hacking™ Hub App. This should enable you to get up and running with the newest technology feature of the Career Hacking™ course quickly!April 20th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.3?We've started responding to the Coronavirus pandemic by adding additional resources to yourCareer Hacking™ experience.July 30th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.4?After auditing CareerHacking™, we found that some of the course's resources were difficult for mobile users to access. So, we've upgraded the way we saved and uploaded your Career Hacking™ resources, and also added multiple cloud-based (Google Drive)resources.This should make it easier for you to take your CareerHacking™ on mobile devices, and in situations when your access to broadband may be limited.November 2020:What's new in version 6.6?Wow. There are a BUNCHof new updates to your Career Hacking™ course!You have a completely rebuilt resume-writing section. Specifically, your course has transitioned to building your resume in Google Docs by default. This has a number of benefits for you:Your resume is now mobile-friendly. This is increasingly important, because your career conversations are now taking place, in the earliest stages at least, via messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp®, LinkedIn® messenger, Twitter®, DMs, etc.). In those situations, the person on the other end of your message is most likely on a mobile device. Now, when you send them your resume, it will open to a perfectly-formatted, mobile-friendly version.ALL of the Career Hackers in this course will now be able to create best-in-class resumes using the templates provided--whether you have access to Microsoft Word® (a paid software program) or not. Transitioning to Google Docs® makes your Career Hacking™ course more diverse and inclusive for our global Career Hacking™ community.You'll now be able to short link to your resume. This will make it easier for you to share your resume, and you'll look like the tech-savvy person you are when you do it.You'll still be able to export your resume to traditional formats (like PDF and .doc).Important note: You can ABSOLUTELY still use Microsoft Word to build your resume. The course fully supports Microsoft Word®, Pages (Mac), and other word processing softwares.You have a completely rebuilt LinkedIn® section. In recent years, LinkedIn® has made a number of important updates to the layout of the platform, how features are arranged, and how media is presented. So, your new Career Hacking™ course has brand new, fresh tutorials to enable you to take advantage of the Platform's most important tools and features.New content on pre-interviewing and digital messaging. According to our network of labor market experts, an increasing number of career relationships are starting with informal message swaps. For example, you may connect with a recruiter on LinkedIn® and then immediately exchange a few career-related messages with them. Your new Career Hacking™ course embraces this new reality, and equips you with the tools to succeed in these message exchanges. This part of the recruiting process, which we call ""pre-interviewing"", is now covered in the Course.Increased support for remote workers and applying for remote opportunities. An increasing number of roles are remote or partially remote, and these opportunities appeal to many Career Hackers. So, we've integrated a number of changes to your resume-writing, networking, and LinkedIn® profile design approaches that enable you to increase your ability to succeed in the distributed work environment.We've added new Voices from the Field and interview lectures.We've updated your LinkedIn® and resume writing guides, with brand new content that aligns with changes to the respective platforms, approaches, and wording practices involved in creating a stand-out professional profile. Enjoy the updates!November 2020:What's new in version 6.6.1?Your course has a bunch of fresh new links.

Specifically, we've added a new ""Voices from the Field"" lecture where you'll meet a wide variety of professionals who share how they'd like to be approached on LinkedIn® for new networking opportunities. We've also invested in new content for you around the legality of using images sourced from previous employers or partners on your LinkedIn® profile--an area of content for which we have received a number of requests.We've added additional resources for those of you looking to transition into technology roles.We've upgraded many of your tools around using LinkedIn® for networking and for ""pre-interviewing"", because we're seeing an increasing amount of job search activity happening on LinkedIn®.Enjoy the updates!!January 2022:What's new in version 6.7.1?In this update, we've added professionally-developed English-language subtitles to all of the new lectures that were published in the recent upgrade.

You’ve got all the strategies you need in this growth hacking course.   In the first part of the course, you’ll gain essential “big picture” skills, including developing your customer personas, interviewing your target markets, and analyzing your “buyer center” (i.e. the individuals in your target market with the most purchasing power).   Next, you’ll learn how to analyze your results. With any growth hacking effort, you always want to know what’s working, where it’s working, and what needs to be changed. For this, you need digital marketing tools like web traffic analysis and lean analytics.  Lastly, you’ll discover highly effective tools to bring boatloads of new customers – ones with money to spend – into your online eco-system. This includes the concepts of digital conversion funnels, lifetime customer value (LTV), and customer acquisition costs (CAC). 

 Develop a User-Centric Approach to Digital Marketing You’ll start by learning what growth hacking is and then move on to building your digital analytics skills.We'll take your Google Analytics skills to the next level by teaching you how to use these advanced tools with real data from the Google Merchandise Store. Then, you'll learn how to develop marketing personas and user segments--using online research methods (like Facebook Audience Insights) and the person-to-person interviewing methods used by companies like IDEOand Apple in Silicon Valley. Then, you'll learn how to work with Pirate Metrics and marketing funnels so that you can guide potential customers through each step... from awareness to revenue to referrals.In the second half of the course, you’ll discover how to create digital marketing materials that target the unique wants and needs of your customer. This might seem like a given, right? In fact, it’s a much rarer skill than you might think, and absolutely crucial for maximizing sales. No growth hacking course is complete without this must-know info! Then you’ll get a crash course in both online SEO and in content marketing, allowing you create relevant and memorable content that’s designed to be discoverable on the web. The email marketing section will introduce you to automated strategies for email. You’ll also develop the ability to use email platforms to manage your subscriber lists.In the later parts of the course, you'll learn how to estimate and use both LifetimeCustomerValue (LTV)and Customer AcquisitionCosts (CAC)--two critical metrics for building a digital marketing engine. The course wraps up with a section on paid acquisition(like PPC Ads andsocial media ads) so that you can bring traffic into the ""top of your funnel"" on-demand.Also, this is version 7 of this course!

PRACTICAL TRAINING WITH REAL SPATIAL DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















DEVELOP MAD GIS SKILLS AND PERFORM SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS USING FREE KICKASS TOOLS SUCH AS QGIS, R, GRASS AND GOOGLE EARTH. 

















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















This course is designed to take users who use R and QGIS for basic spatial data/GIS analysis to perform more advanced GIS tasks (including automated workflows and geo-referencing) using a variety of different data. In addition to making you proficient in R and QGIS for spatial data analysis, you will be introduced to another powerful free GIS software.. GRASS.

















This course takes a completely practical approach to spatial data analysis and mapping- Each lecture will teach you a practical application/processing technique which you can apply easily.

















The course is taught by Minerva Singh, A PhD graduate from Cambridge University, UK, who has several years of research experience in Quantitative Ecology and an MPhil in Geography and Environment from Oxford University. Minerva has published papers in international peer reviewed journals and given talks at international conferences.  

















The underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can put spatial data analysis into practice today and develop sound GIS analysis skills. You’ll be able to start analyzing spatial data for your own projects, and IMPRESS YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYERS with examples of your PRACTICAL spatial data analysis abilities. This course is different from other training resources. Each lecture seeks to enhance your GIS skills in a demonstrable and tangible manner and provide you with practically implementable GIS solutions.

















This is an intermediate course in spatial data analysis, i.e. we will build on on basic spatial data analysis tasks (such as those covered in the beginner version course: Core Spatial Data Analysis: Introductory GIS with R and QGIS) and teach users how to practically implement more complex GIS tasks such as interpolation, mapping spatial data, geo-referencing and detailed vector processing. Additionally you will be introduced to preliminary geo-statistics and mapping/visualizing spatial data. 

















This course covers complex GIS techniques, and by completing this course, you will be implementing these PRACTICALLY in freely-available software, thus making you MORE ATTRACTIVE TO EMPLOYERS.  

















It is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend a tiny amount of time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts pertaining to the different spatial data analysis techniques demonstrated in the course. However, majority of the course will focus on working with real spatial data from different sources. After each video you will learn how to practically implement a new concept or technique in the different softwares used for the course.

















During the course of my research I have discovered that R is a powerful tool for collating and analyzing spatial data acquired from different sources.  Proficiency in spatial data analysis in R and QGIS has helped me publish more peer reviewed papers faster. Feel free to check out my profile on ResearchGate.

















FREE BONUS: You will have access to all the data used in the course, along with the R code files. You will also have access to future lectures, resources and R code files. Enroll in the course today  take advantage of this special bonus!

















I don’t have to remind you that we have a RISK-FREE GUARANTEE in the case of you not being satisfied with the course. Take action now!

87,3491366,*NEW* Advanced Forms - 2022 Build & Master Web forms,"THENITTYGRITTYOFWEBFORMS?A web form is also known as an HTML form. It’s a place where users can enter data that’s then sent to a server for processing. Web forms allow users to place orders on your site, to provide their name and email address to sign up for a newsletter, or to sign up as a member to your site and so forth.What’s really great about web forms is that there is no “one size fits all”. You can use your artistic flare, and personal business acumen to create web forms with a particular length, format, content type and appearance.By doing this course, you’ll be able to improve your web form usability, which will ultimately enhance user experience and get website visitors excited about completing your form and converting.Why is this course so important?Forms which are on point present an opportunity for a company to grow and capture loyalty.A form can often be both a marketing tool and a necessity. A form that puts the user at ease, that evokes feelings of trust, will get filled out far more often than a form which looks (or is) complicated and confusing. After completing my “Advanced Forms” course, you will be knowledgeable, confident and the “go-to” person for forms.Let me share my form building skills with youUnderstanding how forms work will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master forms and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering a perfect, interactive and functional form is challenging. In this course, I take a deep-dive into explaining web forms and how they work. Why do we need to wrap our form within form tags? How can you include a progress bar in a form? How can you customize a toggle or checkbox? Where does the data go once a user clicks on the submit button? How can you perform validation on your form? How can a user upload a file? What happens once the data arrives at the server? What are the different types of events we can listen to on forms? By understanding these questions, and many more in the course, you will be able to build advanced forms and better yet, understand the full stack process! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic forms that improve user engagement and experience.WHATTHISCOURSECOVERSThis course is huge and comprehensive, from basics to advancedThis course will give you solid fundamentals and practicals regarding forms. It can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from this course with an advanced understanding and practical experience with building forms. It will take you to the point where you will understand what method (GET or POST) to use when sending form data, how to define where the data goes, how to perform advanced client-side validation (checking errors on the form before it is sent to the server), how to write custom pattern validation rules (using regular expressions), how to run servers and how to view all HTTP request information. This is awesome knowledge. This course will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end form web development.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” FORMS by gaining an understanding of how you can build it, manipulate it and style it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Why should you learn so much about forms?A web form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a relationship with them. The time you spend in bringing the user to your website should be matched with the time spent in perfecting the user experience with your web forms. It is surprising to see so many sites these days contain complex and frustrating web forms that cause a negative experience.Ultimately, a web form allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalogue request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database.Can you begin to see how important forms are and how their use can be escalated?*** A comprehensive FORMScourse on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how HTML code works behind the scenes. This is particularly true when it comes to building forms. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know, really know, how forms work. You need to understand how the browser URL encodes form data, how the browser sends data to a URL that you specify, and how to perform validation to ensure the user does not submit invalid data.A unique approachYou will learn ""why"" things work and not just ""how"". Understanding advanced topics about forms (lURL encoding, accept-charset, multipart/form-data, regex, etc) is important as it will give you infinite possibilities and upskill you. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create forms that are tailored to your needs, and allow the form data to get submitted to a server via AJAX. You will be able to create forms that are customizable by the user (for example, if the user wants to change the color of the form theme). You can create a control on a form that displays the progress completion of the form and displays messages to the user along the way.Can you begin to see how pivotal forms are and how important having knowledge about forms is?How is this course different?There are lots of courses that focus on web development. Many never get into the detail about how HTML forms work behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master in order to utilize potential.In this course, I focus on the more advanced topics of true web development when it comes to forms. This includes understanding what all of the attributes on the form element mean, understanding the different input types in detail, what URL encoding is, and how data is sent over the wire to a server.Practice makes perfectTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.I love practical examples, which is why we build multiple forms in this course, starting in section 1.Is this course for you?Absolutely. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:Student #1: You want to advance in the world of programming.Student #2: You want to know how successful developers build dynamic forms that engage with the user, have high conversions that put them ahead of the competition.Student #3: You want to gain a solid understanding of how forms really workStudent #4: You want to start using backend technologies like Node or PHP with formsWHY START NOW?Right this second, your competitors are learning how to become better web developers.Web development is a blazing hot topic at the moment, and in the foreseeable future. But you have a distinct advantage. This course offers memorable learning topics, actionable tactics and real-world examples.Lets get started!What do you get?Lifetime access to all tutorial videos. No fees or monthly subscriptions.QA support.Quizzes, coding challenges, a test and assignments to help you learn.I’ve allowed you to download all of my lectures for offline viewing.Let's get excited about becoming a professional web developer, and to be able to confidently apply it to your own websites.See you in the lectures.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/master-web-forms/,1301,Web Development,245,217,Clyde Matthew,"A desire to become an informed full stack web developer

88,2696476,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 1,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youUnderstanding the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. How exactly does the browser model your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Where can we access this model? What can we do with this model? How can we change this model? By understanding these questions, you will be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 1 of 2This course is the first course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do Course 2) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 1 with a basic understanding and practical experience. It will take you to the point where you will understand what the DOM is, why we need it, how to access it, where to find it and how to manipulate it. This is awesome knowledge. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development.In this course you’ll learn about front-end Web Development, by mastering the Document Object Model.Why do you need to know about the DOM?So, you know some HTML, you’ve created your first tags, learned about CSS, made awesome forms, star-gazing buttons, responsive pages and have started to create dynamic and interesting pages.But now you want to do more: “How can I add animation (and life) to my page? I wish I could give an error message to a user who incorrectly submits a form!”And this is where the DOM comes into the picture. and where this course(s) provide you with an opportunity to grow in your skills.To cut a long story short, we use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.The first step in understanding the DOM is understanding what it is. How does it differ from your HTML markup? How does it differ from JavaScript? From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to access the DOM. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to access and traverse the DOM. We don’t stop here, but then get into more advanced things like manipulating the DOM (via the create and remove methods given to us by the DOM API).Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” DOM by gaining an understanding of where you can find it, how you can access it, and more importantly, how you can manipulate it. We dig deeper in every lecture, learning about things like Nodes, the difference between HTTPCollections vs NodeLists, and a whole bunch more! This course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new remove API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** A must-do Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how your browser represents your HTML code and works behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to deal with the DOM. You need to know how to access it, how to manipulate it, and how to dynamically interact with it.I want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.I want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.This course is perfect for you.DescriptionHi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to learn how successful web developers can create whizbang websites that are dynamic and engaging!The root to understanding how to be a professional front-end web developer is understanding the Document Object Model and applying it to practical situations. We're going to practice and learn and emerge confident to tackle any challenges modern programs and websites throw at us.After completing a few university degrees, and post graduate studies, I developed a fascination for web design and software languages. For several years I have immersed myself in this. I spent a fair bit on top courses and went on to apply the knowledge practically.

89,2733254,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 2,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youMastering the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end web programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. In this advanced course, we take a deep-dive into DOM events. What are they? Why are they important? The different types of events we can listen to? Where do they come from? What is event bubbling and event capturing, and how does it help? By understanding these questions, and more, you'll be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 2 of 2This course is the second and final course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do both courses) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 2 with a solid understanding and practical experience of working with events in the DOM. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development. In this course you’ll learn more about front-end web development, by working with events in the Document Object Model.Why this course?Why do you need to know about events in the DOM?If you've ever wondered how you can add animation (and life) to a page, then you need to understand how events work in the DOM. We use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.This course starts off with understanding what an event is. What are the 2 most important things when it comes to events? What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler? From there, you’ll start exploring the different ways you can add events to your code. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to ‘listen’ for events on your web page and then interact with the page when those events happen. We don’t stop here, but get into more advanced things like learning about how an event travels in the DOM (capturing vs bubbling), which leads us to an even more important topic of ... wait for it ... event delegation. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We go into many other things like DOM extensions, object hierarchy and a bunch of other stuff.Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” DOM by gaining an understanding of how you can manipulate it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new classList API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** An advanced Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code.

Take control through understanding. Delivering a fast web experience requires a lot of work by the browser. Most of this work is hidden from web developers: we write the markup, and a nice looking page comes out on the screen. But how exactly does the browser go from consuming our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rendered pixels on the screen? By understanding this, you will be able to write better code in order to boost your website traffic, know how to precision fix and tweak behaviour and performance, improve your market penetration and your margins. You’ll also gain an advantages over other developers who seem to just push the buttons without fully appreciating what is happening.What this course covers?In this course you’ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path. This refers to the set of steps browsers must take to fetch and then convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living, breathing websites. From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to measure performance. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to deliver the first pixels to the screen as early as possible.Knowledge of the CRP is incredibly useful for understanding how a site's performance can be improved.

Change all of that by enrolling in ""Sourdough Bread Baking 101.""This is the sourdough baking course you need if you are just starting out in sourdough bread baking. In my other courses, I teach how to bake all sorts of sourdough breads, but in this course, I won't load you down with lots of information, just enough so it is easy and fun to bake your first loaf of sourdough. You will first learn how to make your own sourdough starter at home, day by day with detailed instructions, videos and a free pdf downloadable booklet. Next, you'll move onto baking waffles to test your new sourdough starter and then onto your first sourdough test loaf. Once you've taken a basic white sourdough loaf, steaming hot, out of your own oven, you will be ready to move on to more complex formulas. There are two basic sourdough bread formulas in this course. I call them ""First Loaf"" and ""Second Loaf."" We will follow the easy step by step directions of the process together. The first loaf is easy. It is a one day round boule with a lower hydration dough, which means it is not too wet or sticky. The second loaf is a two day high hydration dough and is a batard or French style loaf. Working together, I will show you how to handle a wet, sticky dough and how to do an autolyse. This bread results in a lovely tasting bread with large holes and a wonderful crispy crust. This course is for BEGINNERS who have no idea of how to bake with sourdough or those who have tried and stumbled. I have fifteen years of experience teaching the newbie sourdough baker, so come on! Let's have some fun! You know want to!This course would make an excellent gift for the aspiring baker in your family circle, whether an older baker or a young new baker. Some skills you will learn:How to make and care for your own sourdough starterWhy it's important to weigh ingredients. Gathering some basic baking equipmentHow to mix and fold dough. No kneading here.Shaping, scoring and baking the dough.What to do after you've baked your first loaf... hint (bake your second loaf!)When you have finished Sourdough Bread Baking 101, you will have the confidence to not only bake using your own sourdough starter, you will be ready for more advanced sourdough baking techniques which will enable you to bake all sorts of sourdough artisan breads.

132,430604,12 Strategies for Dealing With Difficult People,"I'm right there with you my friend.  Difficult People Suck!Let me ask a few questions.Are you frustrated with difficult people?Do you find difficult people to be challenging? Who are some difficult people in your life? Your boss? Coworkers and customers? Your spouse/partner? Your kids?Do you feel trapped?Are you losing sleep? (This is a big healthy lifestyle red flag!)Do you pause for a moment to take a deep breath before you go into work, or a meeting, just to prepare yourself for the onslaught you know you are going to deal with?Have you ever looked at your paycheck to see if you have enough sick time built up so you just don't have to go into work today? How did you feel when you realized you didn't have enough time built up and you had to go it? Even sicker? I get it.Again, I'm right there with you my friend. I have lost entire weekends due to the overwhelming stress caused by that one difficult customer I'm scheduled to meet on Monday morning. So much stress I couldn't leave it behind, even for a few hours, to really enjoy time with my family. Does this sentence sound familiar? “Your here but you are not really here.” I get it.Difficult people SUCK!I have screamed at the top of my lungs, in my car, while back fisting the passenger seat headrest to the point I’ve ripped the skin off my knuckles. I even purchased a new mattress and pillow thinking that it might actually help me sleep through the night. It didn’t work. I still didn’t sleep well and the stress just kept building.I’ve purchased Melatonin (sleep aid) even when it wasn’t on a Buy One Get One sale. I can also find the bottle of Tylenol PM in complete darkness at 02:00 AM. I've walked away from jobs, that I've loved, due to a boss being so unreasonably difficult I just couldn't put my job in front of my health any longer. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this, but there must be some sort of science that explains why the air instantly seems fresher the moment you choose to walk (or run) away from a toxic situation.Difficult people are just unhealthy.  I’ve skipped meals because I was too stressed to eat which usually resulted in me hitting a drive-through just because “I just need something.” 40+ pounds later…”Well, this isn’t working for me.” I get it.Difficult people have caused me to be physically sick. I've felt physical back pain because I was so stressed out and tense knowing that I was going to be dealing with difficult co-workers tomorrow.Let me ask a couple more questions:What would it feel like to sleep peacefully throughout the night?Wouldn't it be great to have a few key strategies that make dealing with difficult people a lot easier? What would it feel like to have control of the situation?What would it feel like to be able to leave work behind and enjoy your evening, your weekend, or even your vacation?What would it feel like to actually “Look forward to work tomorrow”?What would it feel like to have the power to “Fire” that one difficult customer that takes up so much of your time, your thoughts, and your work?What if dealing with difficult people actually becomes a fun game you become really good at playing?Once I began to master these strategies, the air became fresher, my sleep improved, and I became healthier and happier.

135,949846,3 Minute French - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Bonjour et bienvenue :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute French as a way to make learning French easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the French language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no French at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak French, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn French.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE FRENCH WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of French that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak French comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a French speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep French fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with French and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning French with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work well.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak French you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute French today.Merci :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-full-course-1/,263,Language Learning,106,82,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no French and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute French courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in French. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the French language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in French, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in French so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute French courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the French structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your French vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-course-2/,266,Language Learning,93,80,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute French Course 1""

We'll look at some new verbs and learn how they are used differently in French to how they're used in English. We'll also begin to look at a very useful tool for new language learners: directions. Learning how to ask for directions is invaluable, because it will very often be one of the easiest ways for you to start to tune your ear into the French language. I'll give you a few tips on how to do this.The sentences in this course might seem a little longer than the ones we've been used to, so far, but this is a great way for you to get your tongue around the French pronunciation.

146,943496,3 Minute German - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Hallo und wilkommen :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute German as a way to make learning German easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the German language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no German at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak German, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn German.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE GERMAN WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of German that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak German comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a German speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep German fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with German and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning German with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak German you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute German today.Danke :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-german-full-course-1/,283,Language Learning,100,89,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no German and nothing about languages

157,979222,3 Minute Portuguese - Course 1 | Lessons for beginners,"Olá e bem-vindo :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute Portuguese as a way to make learning Portuguese easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the Portuguese language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no Portuguese at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak Portuguese, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn Portuguese.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE PORTUGUESE WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of Portuguese that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak Portuguese comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a Portuguese speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep Portuguese fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with Portuguese and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Portuguese with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Portuguese you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Portuguese today.Obrigado :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-portuguese-full-course-1/,220,Language Learning,75,66,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no Portuguese and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute Spanish courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in Spanish. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the Spanish language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in Spanish, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in Spanish so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute Spanish courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the Spanish structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your Spanish vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-spanish-course-2/,288,Language Learning,103,90,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute Spanish Course 1""

I'll show you how to create compelling models, how to use Blender's logic bricks to write basic games with no programming, and we'll finally transition to writing your own code with the powerful and popular Python language built into Blender.  I've had a blast creating this course.  I can't wait to share it with you.  The best part of making a game is storing your own playfulness inside a game.  I see this course in exactly the same way.  Let's play together and build some awesome games.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3d-game-development-with-blender/,671,Game Development,40,40,Andy Harris,"Please download and install a recent version of Blender (2.76 or greater.)

183,1095384,"3ds Max + AE: Learn VFX, Camera Tracking and Compositing","There are few better ways to present a project to your clients than through aerial fly-overs of a proposed building.  Drones have made it easier than ever to aerial footage of your projects sites.  In this course you will learn to take drone footage (or really any kind of footage), whether it is shot by you or someone else, and composite in your 3D creations easily and convincingly. 3DS Max and After Effects already have all the built-in tools that you need for creating visual effects using 3D composited into live footage.  Follow this course and you will be amazed at how quickly and easily you can be up to speed, creating your own movie-like effects, using software you probably already have access to.

This course is broken down into three main sections:





Inside of After Effects -- This is where I will show you how to generate and export 3D camera tracking data for later use in 3DS Max.Inside 3DS Max -- From AE, we will get a camera the exactly matches the zoom angle and movement of our live video footage, but in Max we will have to adjust its scale and rotation in order to get it to match with the real world.  Once we have that, we can add any 3D elements we want to the footage.Bring It All Back Together In After Effects -- This is where we will do some compositing. The goal is to make the 3D animation elements and the live footage mesh together seamlessly and convincingly.





This course is hands on.  You will be following along with me creating a basic aerial fly-over.  You will learn the exact workflow that you need, plus a ton of tips and tricks that will help you to not get hung up when you graduate to your own projects.  I have already done all the troubleshooting for you, so learn from my experience. Check out the promo video to learn more about me, and about the project you will creating in the course.

198,2098232,4G LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - Concepts and call flows,"LTE (4G) is the first network technology that is capable of delivering high-speed data to subscribers. It is the most widely deployed 3GPP technology and its adoption has been the fastest compared to its predecessors (2G, 3G). 4G LTE lays the foundation for the future 5G networks. This course is designed to provide students with in-depth information regarding LTE EPC architecture. The course has been designed for all levels and starts off by providing the introduction to LTE and its advantages over legacy technologies. We then quickly start by building the foundation needed to understand the LTE technology and its architecture. During the lectures, all concepts are introduced by means of intuitive diagrams and real-network examples whenever possible.  Here are some of the reasons why this course is different compared to others - 1. Robust structureLTE EPC is a complex and very exhaustive topic. That is why we have organized the lectures in a way that students can quickly understand concepts.2. Intuitive Examples and Use Cases So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory. But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind LTE.3. Real network Examples In this course, we use real Wireshark traces from a test network to describe call flows rather than just relying on theory. This way we are able to deliver practical information to the students that will help them in real-world scenarios.4. 3GPP based material Throughout the course, we refer to the relevant 3GPP specifications so that students can become familiar with 3GPP specifications. 5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT  Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful LTE EPC course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help. No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. Therefore, feel free to send us a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Good Luck and Happy learning!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/4g-lte-evolved-packet-core-deep-dive-and-call-flows/,291,Network & Security,22,21,Suryabh S,"Laptop with Internet connectivity

Join more than 7,000 students learning about interesting research in psychology!



If you've ever wanted an easy way to start learning about psychology, this is the course for you!



In this free course, you'll learn about 5 studies in psychology and see how their results reveal interesting things about human thought and behavior.



The studies in this course reveal…



how we can persuade someone to do what we want without even providing good reasonswhy praising some kids for their intelligence vs. their hard word dramatically changed their test scoreswhy people who held a hot cup of coffee instead of an iced coffee automatically started thinking a stranger was especially generous and caring…and more!



Carefully designed experiments tell us a great deal about the choices we make, the ways we behave, and why we think the way we do. I'm a social psychologist myself, and I thought about which studies most interested me early in my education and which studies are my current favorites. I even reached out to my colleagues to ask them what studies have most inspired them and are important for everyone to know about.



So enroll in this fun introductory course and start seeing how simple research in psychology tells us amazing things about human thought and behavior!

Es un método maravilloso si es que necesitas desarrollar aplicaciones rápidas, sin tanta personalización.ADO.NET - Capa Conectada: Este mecanismo, nos permite ejecutar consultas a la base de datos directamente, con la advertencia de que tendremos que tener una conexión abierta para interactuar con la base de datos.ADO.NET - Capa Desconectada: Con este otro mecanismo, en lugar de tener una conexión abierta en todo momento, llenamos un objeto tipo DataSet, el cual contendrá una copia de la información que especifiquemos, para trabajar con dicha información fuera de línea, es decir, que no tendremos que estar conectados a la base de datos para utilizar la información.Dapper: Un simple, pero efectivo mapeador de objetos para .NET, con el cual, podremos consultar información de una tabla con tan sólo algunas líneas de código.Entity Framework: Un completo ORM (Mapeador de objetos relacionales) lanzado por Microsoft, la cual es una herramienta que simplifica el mapeo entre objetos a las tablas y columnas de una base de datos relacional.Sin duda, esta es una guía excelente, para aquellos que apenas inician con .Net y C#, o bien, para aquellos que ya tienen experiencia desarrollando con alguno de estas técnicas, pero desconoce completamente sobre los demás temas.¿Qué esperas para conectar tu aplicación a tu base de datos SQL Server?",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/conectar-c-sharp-a-sql-server/,463,Programming Languages,61,60,Héctor Uriel Pérez,"Nociones básicas de C#

217,1154438,50 Tools for the Ultimate Accelerated Learning Office,"(Make sure to read about the special 2-for-1 course bonus at the bottom of this description)

This course has a history...







In 2014 I published my second course (I now have over 50 available on Udemy). 







It was called 50 Learning Machines. 







It was my collection of all my favorite software tools for learning faster. 









As a bonus, I included about 15 of my favorite pieces of hardware that I use for learning.









It turned out that this hardware bonus was just as popular, if not more popular, with my students than the software, apps and plugins I recommended in the main body of the course.









Over the years I've added to my collection of hardware tools and developed this idea of building hte ultimate workbench for accelerated learners.









This course is the result of that 3 year mission. 









This time around all 50 machines are hardware tools, and I've even included some bonuses on top of the original 50 that cover some cutting edge technology that I think is worth taking a look at. 









This course has cost me over $10,000 in testing to create. I've tested tons of different items to come up with this final list. I've done lots of research on each category of tool to find the best in the category. I've optimized for price and performance. 









Along with the tools, I also share how I use them, which is just as valuable, if not more so, than the list of tools itself. 









You'll learn many strategies here that I don't teach in my other courses and am revealing here for the first time. 









The first edition of 50 Learning Machines was one of my best selling courses and great reviews. 









BONUS for a limited time:









As a bonus, every student that finishes this course to 100% will get free access to the original 50 learning machines course with all the original software, mobile apps and browser extensions completely free. 









See you on the inside.

Scroll below for the answer...Correct: 1.Correct option:AWS Storage GatewayAWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your existing on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud. Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving tape backups to the cloud, reducing on-premises storage with cloud-backed file shares, providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications, as well as various migration, archiving, processing, and disaster recovery use cases.AWS Storage Gateway service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access.Incorrect options:""AWS Direct Connect"" - AWS Direct Connect creates a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC. This is a private connection and does not use the public internet. Takes at least a month to establish this connection. Direct Connect is a connectivity service and you cannot use it to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""AWS Snowball"" - AWS Snowball is a data transport solution that accelerates moving terabytes to petabytes of data into and out of AWS services using storage devices designed to be secure for physical transport. You cannot use Snowball to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""Amazon EBS"" - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

Well, yes!







Why an hour? Because that's all you need as an experienced developer!







We'll see the basics constructs of the language - variables, conditionals, loops, strings and arrays. Being an experienced developer you probably don't need an explanation of ""what a loop is"" but you want to see how loop is done in Kotlin. This is my attitude through all this course - I won't waste your time in telling you things you already know. I'll try to show you new things and give you the direction to go on.







Developers: want a fast introduction to Kotlin? If you're familiar with Java, I can help you get up to speed in just a couple of of hours.







Kotlin is a fascinating new language that's attracted lots of attention, including from Google. In this short course you'll get to know Kotlin and its essentials. You'll be able to start writing code in no time. 









































If you are an experienced developer and heard the buzz about Kotlin - this course is for you.

























If you are a Java developer and want to dive into Kotlin, I'll help you translate your Java knowledge into Kotlin expertise in no time.

























If you are a Java developer and heard all those talking about Kotlin, but you don't know where to start - start here. Your java knowledge will be translated quickly into kotlin.





















In this course I'll show you the essentials of this young and amazing language. We'll work with the IntelliJ IDE but if you just want to taste the language without any downloads or installations - that's fine, I'll introduce the Kotlin Playground which is a great tool for writing and evaluating Kotlin on line without any configurations.





















We'll see how Kotlin's functions work, and how functional programming is done in Kotlin.





















We'll see how OOP is done in Kotlin and what are the main improvements over java.





















Finally, I'll give you some suggestions to what else can be done and which topics you might want to get interested in the Kotlin's ecosystem.





















Hope you choose to take this course and get to know Kotlin, a fascinating new language!

You’re in for a treat.  This is my favorite UX web design project for GIMP users!  You’ll learn something you didn’t know was possible… how to find out what font was used from a (flattened) JPG file!  Yep, I’ll show you where to upload your file and a computer will crunch it’s database of 100,000+ fonts and tell you which one was used!So far, most of our UX web design projects have had a modern, clean UX web design style applied to them.  Not this time.  We’re going all out on transforming a plain, boring site with a bold, fun retro web design style.  Oh, and we are still focusing on an awesome (UX) user experience with the overall web design.You’ll start off by creating a retro slider for the Hero section.  Then you’ll design an e-commerce like body section featuring old-movie posters.  Plus, I've added more pro UX (user experience) web design tips and useful tips for using GIMP!GIMP Web Design Project 7By now, you’ve learned just about all my UX web design tips.  Don’t despair.  I have a few more pro tips and GIMP tricks to share with you in this final UX web design project.Including, how to transform an ordinary, boring, plain, photo into a work-of-art; a Watercolor (in GIMP).  No worries.  No need to buy a canvas, brushes or watercolor paint.  I’ll show you how to do it all in GIMP!Once you’ve completed all 7 GIMP UX web design projects you’ll have mastered over a dozen keyboard shortcuts (that will help you design faster).  Plus, if you applied my suggestions and did the 7 web design assignments, you’ll have 7 UX web designs developed from YOUR creative vision to use in your portfolio.  All of which, can be submitted to our QA section for feedback or just to show off your new UX web design skills!Learn GIMP web design by doing!

By doing this, we will complete objectives 11, 12, 13 and parts of 6 and 18 from the 70-461 exam.Session 5We'll will now be creating aggregate queries, working through objective 9 of the exam 70-461. We'll be reviewing the ranking functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK and NTILE. We'll look at the 8 analytic functions news to SQL Server 2012, such as LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.We'll look at alternative ways of grouping and adding totals, using ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS and GROUPING_ID. If you want to take the 70-461 exam, we'll also look at the geometry and geography data types, plotting locations on a grid, together with functions and aggregates.Session 6We'll will now be creating sub-queries, working through objectives 7b-e of the exam 70-461. We'll be created correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We'll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we'll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.We'll be looking at functions (objective 14), including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We'll then complete objective 6 by looking at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and objective 8 by looking at the use of GUIDs. We'll also look at sequences. We'll have a look at XML. Finally, for SQL Server 2016 and later (exam 70-761), we'll examine JSON and Temporal Tables.Session 7In this session we'll be looking at transactions, seeing how to explicitly start and end them, and finding out how they can block other users in the database. Then we'll see about how to indexes and their role in optimising queries. We'll also see how we can use Dynamic Management Views to see how we can improve our use of indexes. We'll then look at how to write a cursor, and when to use this row-based operation, and the impact of using scalar UDFs.No prior knowledge is required - I'll even show you how to install SQL Server on your computer for free!There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.Once finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in T-SQL.

However, the information in this course is still relevant to DBA.Do you want to gain practical experience in Database Administration in SQLServer?Welcome.In this course, learn some of the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV or resume, and even go for the official Microsoft certification.SQLServer is one of the main database tools that is requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to do DBA for SQLServer could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.We'll download and install for free SQLServer Developer, which gives you all of the capabilities of the full-cost Enterprise edition (though without being able to use it for commercial purposes). We'll start by downloading a demonstration database, and learning how to backup and restore this database, and what recovery models are appropriate for other databases, to enable you to offer Point in Time recovery.We'll manage logins and server roles, so you can control who gets access to what data, implement and maintain indexes, so you can speed up searches, and import and export data. We'll look at managing SQLServer Agent, so you can automate routine tasks, and also be alerted to problems, we'll manage and configure databases, and look at compression, both of which aids with administrating big databases. And much more.The course will take around 10 hours to complete,but completing this will enable you to versed in Database Administration tasks, giving you hands-on experience.The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll manually backup a database, but then later we'll use SQLServer Agent to automate this. In this course, we will only do activities that require one computer, instead of multiple servers or virtualization.The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual DBA will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.No knowledge of T-SQLis required, as I'll demonstrate everything Ican through the GUI(Graphical User Interface) as well as T-SQL.

If this issue doesn't directly affect me, why should I care?



The truth is you don't know that no one in your life is transgender and there's a very good chance that if you've said anything remotely like the above to them, they might never feel safe enough to tell you. 



A Beginner's Guide to Trans 101 is the very basic foundation for developing cultural competence in working with transgender individuals. With the increased visibility of the transgender community more industries and individuals are finding the need to increase their knowledge and understanding of issues that effect the transgender community. 



It is important to learn appropriate and inappropriate ways to interact with members of the community so that your communication can be positive, non-stigmatizing and successful. And, well, just basically not be jerk.

Video lectures are great for learning concepts, but can be difficult to skim through later when you're trying to remember what you learned. Because of this, this course includes video lectures AND written articles. Nearly every video is accompanied with a written article so you can reinforce your learning, and have an easy way to skim through and study the tougher concepts.

From the educational side, it boosts people's understanding by simplifying many complex concepts. From the industry point of view, models are much easier to understand, maintain, and develop.Deep Learning is one of the fastest growing areas of Artificial Intelligence. In the past few years, we have proven that Deep Learning models, even the simplest ones, can solve very hard and complex tasks. Now, that the buzz-word period of Deep Learning has, partially, passed, people are releasing its power and potential for their product improvements.The course is structured in a way to cover all topics from neural network modeling and training to put it in production.In Part 1 of the course, you will learn about the technology stack that we will use throughout the course (Section 1) and the TensorFlow 2.0 library basics and syntax (Section 2).In Part 2 of the course, we will dig into the exciting world of deep learning. Through this part of the course, you will implement several types of neural networks (Fully Connected Neural Network (Section 3), Convolutional Neural Network (Section 4), Recurrent Neural Network (Section 5)). At the end of this part, Section 6, you will learn and build their own Transfer Learning application that achieves state of the art (SOTA) results on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.After passing the part 2 of the course and ultimately learning how to implement neural networks, in Part 3 of the course, you will learn how to make your own Stock Market trading bot using Reinforcement Learning, specifically Deep-Q Network.Part 4 is all about TensorFlow Extended (TFX). In this part of the course, you will learn how to work with data and create your own data pipelines for production. In Section 8 we will check if the dataset has any anomalies using the TensorFlow Data Validation library and after learn how to check a dataset for anomalies, in Section 9, we will make our own data preprocessing pipeline using the TensorFlow Transform library.In Section 10 of the course, you will learn and create your own Fashion API using the Flask Python library and a pre-trained model. Throughout this section, you will get a better picture of how to send a request to a model over the internet. However, at this stage, the architecture around the model is not scalable to millions of request. Enter the Section 11. In this section of the course, you will learn how to improve solution from the previous section by using the TensorFlow Serving library. In a very easy way, you will learn and create your own Image Classification API that can support millions of requests per day!These days it is becoming more and more popular to have a Deep Learning model inside an Android or iOS application, but neural networks require a lot of power and resources! That's where the TensorFlow Lite library comes into play. In Section 12 of the course, you will learn how to optimize and convert any neural network to be suitable for a mobile device.To conclude with the learning process and the Part 5 of the course, in Section 13 you will learn how to distribute the training of any Neural Network to multiple GPUs or even Servers using the TensorFlow 2.0 library.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-2/,785,Machine Learning,133,120,"Hadelin de Ponteves

278,4221858,A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro),"Deep learning is increasingly dominating technology and has major implications for society.From self-driving cars to medical diagnoses, from face recognition to deep fakes, and from language translation to music generation, deep learning is spreading like wildfire throughout all areas of modern technology.But deep learning is not only about super-fancy, cutting-edge, highly sophisticated applications. Deep learning is increasingly becoming a standard tool in machine-learning, data science, and statistics. Deep learning is used by small startups for data mining and dimension reduction, by governments for detecting tax evasion, and by scientists for detecting patterns in their research data.Deep learning is now used in most areas of technology, business, and entertainment. And it's becoming more important every year.How does deep learning work?Deep learning is built on a really simple principle: Take a super-simple algorithm (weighted sum and nonlinearity), and repeat it many many times until the result is an incredibly complex and sophisticated learned representation of the data.Is it really that simple?mmm OK, it's actually a tiny bit more complicated than that ;) but that's the core idea, and everything else -- literally everything else in deep learning -- is just clever ways of putting together these fundamental building blocks. That doesn't mean the deep neural networks are trivial to understand:there are important architectural differences between feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks.Given the diversity of deep learning model designs, parameters, and applications, you can only learn deep learning -- Imean, really learn deep learning, not just have superficial knowledge from a youtube video -- by having an experienced teacher guide you through the math, implementations, and reasoning. And of course, you need to have lots of hands-on examples and practice problems to work through. Deep learning is basically just applied math, and, as everyone knows, math is not a spectator sport!What is this course all about?Simply put:The purpose of this course is to provide a deep-dive into deep learning. You will gain flexible, fundamental, and lasting expertise on deep learning. You will have a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts in deep learning, so that you will be able to learn new topics and trends that emerge in the future.Please note:This is not a course for someone who wants a quick overview of deep learning with a few solved examples. Instead, this course is designed for people who really want to understand how and why deep learning works; when and how to select metaparameters like optimizers, normalizations, and learning rates; how to evaluate the performance of deep neural network models; and how to modify and adapt existing models to solve new problems.You can learn everything about deep learning in this course.In this course, you will learn Theory:Why are deep learning models built the way they are? Math:What are the formulas and mechanisms of deep learning?Implementation:How are deep learning models actually constructed in Python (using the PyTorch library)?Intuition: Why is this or that metaparameter the right choice? How to interpret the effects of regularization?etc.Python:If you're completely new to Python, go through the 8+ hour coding tutorial appendix. If you're already a knowledgeable coder, then you'll still learn some new tricks and code optimizations.Google-colab:Colab is an amazing online tool for running Python code, simulations, and heavy computations using Google's cloud services. No need to install anything on your computer.Unique aspects of this courseClear and comprehensible explanations of concepts in deep learning.Several distinct explanations of the same ideas, which is a proven technique for learning.Visualizations using graphs, numbers, and spaces that provide intuition of artificial neural networks.LOTSof exercises, projects, code-challenges, suggestions for exploring the code. You learn best by doing it yourself!Active QA forum where you can ask questions, get feedback, and contribute to the community.8+ hour Python tutorial. That means you don't need to master Python before enrolling in this course.So what are you waiting for??Watch the course introductory video and free sample videos to learn more about the contents of this course and about my teaching style.

286,1122334,A Practical Introduction to Cloud Computing,"The 2nd top hit for 'Cloud Computing' on Google says 'Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet.' Unfortunately, that definition is completely wrong.

This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.















And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.















I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.















Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listing the Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.















You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different models and then dive deep into the details and options of each. I also give lab demos of how to deploy each type.















The Cloud Deployment Models of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.















Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet to show you how to do a TCO cost comparison when choosing between an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.















A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivation to complete further training and be a real asset to their company.
















As a student in this course, you will get an answer to every question you ask in the Ask Question section. I love interaction with my students- anything you want to know, please ask.

287,3531076,A Professional Introduction to Scrum,"Are you and your team exhausted and frustrated because you are juggling multiple projects and constantly task-switching? Does working this way make it difficult to understand progress or to feel a sense of purpose in your daily work? How often do you discover that what you delivered doesn't achieve desired outcomes? Does quality often get sacrificed under pressure to do more faster? If you are looking for a better way to approach complex work and deliver high value solutions, Scrum is the way. Scrum done well enables business agility, which is essential in our unpredictable and rapidly changing world. Scrum is a framework that helps people productively and creatively solve complex problems and deliver greater value. Scrum enables you to deliver Increments of value working in short cycles. This approach helps you incorporate learning as you do the work, get feedback frequently to make sure you are on the right track, and respond quickly to change.Icreated this Udemy course for you - filled with my unique insights as a licensed Professional Scrum Trainer, Steward of the Professional Scrum Master (PSM)curriculum, and owner of an agility training and coaching business. I have taught over 1,300 students on 5 continents. I am co-author of the book Mastering Professional Scrum, published in 2019 by Pearson Addison-Wesley. Iam also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and started my career working in traditional project management, which gives me a unique perspective to help people understand the difference and make the transition to Scrum and agility if it makes sense for them.Note:This course is up-to-date with the 2020 Scrum Guide.Scrum may have its roots in software, but it has been used well beyond software for decades. I designed the course to help you apply Scrum in any context - from operations to marketing, from projects and products to research and problem solving, and even running departments or entire organizations. Ioffer a wide range of examples to help you see how the concepts can be applied for different types of work.Student Review --""This was a phenomenal course. Stephanie's lectures were fun to watch, and it's clear she knows her material. She spoke at a cadence that was easy to follow, and you can tell she's into what she's teaching. I found her guides to be very helpful and highly recommend signing up for her newsletter. I look forward to taking more courses from Stephanie in the future.""This course is built to help you learn Scrum the right way - in alignment with the official Scrum Guide and leveraging the foundational values and principles. Zero previous Scrum experience is required. In fact, it is often beneficial to have zero experience because you won't have as much to unlearn. In my experience, there are many misunderstandings and myths about Scrum that prevent teams from applying Scrum well and gaining the benefits of agility. This course can also serve as a great refresher and validation of knowledge for people who do have Scrum experience but little to no professional Scrum training. In this course, you will learn to: Identify the key differences between a traditional plan-driven approach and an agile value-driven approachShift your mindset towards an agile way of thinkingDefine the roles, artifacts, and events of the Scrum framework, the importance of each one, and how they all fit together to maximize value deliveryLeverage empiricism and the Scrum values to navigate challenges and maximize the benefits of ScrumDetermine when to use ScrumDefine and meaure valueCreate and evolve a definition of ""Done""Break out of the mindset of focusing on tasks and deliverables and see opportunity to deliver value in entirely new waysRethink how you can iteratively and incrementally deliver valueApply the Goldilocks Principle to Product Backlog RefinementMake the minimal decisions needed to get started with ScrumEstimate and forecast using agile techniquesAvoid using velocity in the wrong waysLeverage an agile approach to managing budgets and schedulesApply my model for improving your Scrum implementation (because there are no best practices when dealing with complex work)Get additional resources to go deeper in your learningAgility is essential in today's environment. Agility is the real competitive advantage. Teams and organizations must be nimble, creative, and resilient in order to effectively navigate complexity and thrive in a constantly changing world. Scrum is used by over 12 million people around the world. While Scrum does have its origins in software development, it has been used well beyond software for decades as more and more teams and organizations have realized their work is complex and their environment is unpredictable and rapidly changing. I offer a wide range of examples to help people understand the concepts and how to apply in their own context.Throughout the course, you will have opportunities to reflect on questions that will help bring the course concepts to life in your own context. Ihave included two canvasesIuse with my coaching clients that will help you start applying Scrum in your work environment. And for those of you who are eager to take your learning deeper, I'll guide you toward next steps.This course is different because it is true to the Scrum Guide and Ken Schwaber's vision, and it is not prescriptive. Agile is not a silver bullet. Scrum is a framework - not a methodology - that leverages the power of a small, self-organizing team. The Scrum Team decides their process within the framework, and that process will evolve as they inspect and adapt, learn and grow. There are no best practices in Scrum because we are dealing with complexity. Best practices only exist in simple environments. A lot of the information you find online and even what is delivered in training does not clarify what is required by Scrum versus what is an example or personal opinion. I aim to teach you the foundational knowledge you need to effectively navigate in your own context. Iprovide examples of helpful practices and advice from my own experience, however, Imake clear distinctions and help you understand why you might use a practice and the benefits it can provide.When applied with discipline and intention, Scrum helps you confidently navigate complexity and uncertainty, deliver greater value, and thrive in a constantly changing world.Are you in for that?Enroll today and begin your Scrum journey with me!(Trust a former project manager and perfectionist...

317,285610,A+ Essays: A Structured Approach to Successful Essay Writing,"Many students become anxious at the prospect of having to write an essay or term paper. They don't understand the conventions for organizing essays, and they don't know how to manage their time and the writing process. The result is that many students enter college without the skills necessary to succeed simply because they were never properly taught how to write essays. This course aims to overcome this problem by offering a systematic framework for essay writing that removes the mystery and presents a clear path for moving from idea to outline to completed first draft. A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO SUCCESSFUL ESSAY WRITINGThe most efficient way to improve your essay writing is to focus on the key structural features that define successful writing at the essay level. An essay can be written beautifully, but if it's missing key structural elements (like a well defined thesis statement), it will fail as an essay.This course provides a set of concepts and tools for thinking about, analyzing and fixing problems with the structural elements of your essay. CONTENTS AND OVERVIEWStudents in this course will learn how essay writing skills are related to ""deep reading"" and ""deep thinking"" skills, and why this is increasingly important in today's world. You will also learn how standards of good essay writing are related to standards of good written communication more broadly. You'll learn why academic essays are structured the way they are, how essay style is related to essay structure, how to approach the writing process, and how to organize your time so that you can actually get the work done before the deadline.But the centerpiece of the course is two detailed case studies. In one of them I take a short student essay that has some serious problems, analyze the structural issues and rewrite that essay from start to finish. In another case study I take an actual essay assignment from an actual college class, that I don't teach, and take that essay from initial brainstorming and researching to a detailed outline to a completed first draft with a reference list and inline reference citations.At the end of this course you will feel more confident about your ability to successfully complete essay assignments in school, and you will have a greater understanding of the skills and habits of successful writers.

That is because WANs designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of WAN traffic that cloud adoption brings. That traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability.Further, opening the enterprise to the Internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. It is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce, including employees, partners, contractors, vendors, and guests. Enabling broadband on the WAN makes the security requirements more acute, creating challenges for IT in balancing user experience, security, and complexity.The new WANNew business models drive the need for a new network model.SD-WAN addresses the current IT challenges. This new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. Network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data privacy.What are the benefits of SD-WAN?The traditional WAN architecture was limited to enterprise, branch, and data center. Once an organization adopts cloud-based applications in the form of SaaS and IaaS, its WAN architecture experiences an explosion of traffic accessing applications distributed across the globe.These changes have multiple implications for IT. Employee productivity may be compromised by SaaS-application performance problems. WAN expenses can rise with inefficient use of dedicated and backup circuits. IT fights a daily, complex battle of connecting multiple types of users with multiple types of devices to multiple cloud environments.With SD-WAN, IT can deliver routing, threat protection, efficient offloading of expensive circuits, and simplification of WAN network management. Business benefits can include the following:Better application experienceHigh availability, with predictable service, for all critical enterprise applicationsMultiple hybrid active-active links for all network scenariosDynamically routed application traffic with application-aware routing, for efficient delivery and improved user experienceImproved OpEx, replacing expensive Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) services with more economical and flexible broadband (including secure VPN connections)More securityApplication-aware policies with end-to-end segmentation and real-time access controlIntegrated threat protection enforced at the right placeSecure traffic across broadband Internet and into the cloudDistribute security to the branch and remote endpoints with NGFW, DNS security, and NGAVOptimized cloud connectivitySeamless extension of the WAN to multiple public cloudsReal-time optimized performance for Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, and other major SaaS applicationsOptimized workflows for cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft AzureSimplified managementA single, centralized, cloud-delivered management dashboard for configuration and management of WAN, cloud, and securityTemplate-based, zero-touch provisioning for all locations: branch, campus, and cloudDetailed reporting of application and WAN performance for business analytics and bandwidth forcasting",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/abc-of-cisco-sdwan-viptela-redundancy-routing-policy/,596,Network & Security,55,55,"Ratnesh K - 20,000+ Students Worldwide","This is for network engineers , my course abc of Cisco SDWAN Viptela required prior to take this course.","Will Come to know how software define Wide Area Network, Redundancy , Routing & Policies Works",en_US,False,IT Operations,Network & Security,0,0,True,English [Auto],596

365,1958472,"Acoustic Guitar Redefined. Learn Chords, Rhythm and Melody!","ACOUSTIC GUITAR REDEFINED is a course for any guitar player who wants to learn how to play chords, melody, and rhythm creatively and practically. If you are tired of playing the same static, boring chords over and over and you want to find a way to make your acoustic guitar sound more interesting without necessarily having to learn crazy stuff, then this program is definitely for you. AS A GUITAR TEACHER, I GET THIS QUESTION A LOT: ""Hey Marco, I have been playing guitar for a while, but I am stuck in a guitar rot. I want to learn a different way of playing chords and melodies to get my motivation back. What should I do and which guitar lessons should I follow?"" If this is your situation, you can do three things: Number 1: You can go on social media and try to figure things out yourself. Places such as YouTube are great, but it can be overwhelming to navigate through thousands of videos for some people. If you want to have access to a vast amount of guitar lessons at zero cost, social media is excellent. If you want a structured program, you should avoid this step.Number 2: Private teachers still represent the best way to learn guitar. You could get assessed by a professional guitar teacher who will fix bad habits, come up with a structured program, and follow you step by step. However, private tutors can be quite expensive. You will also have to deal with location and availability. If you don't have much time available, this option doesn't work. Number 3: You could find an excellent online guitar course that fits your music style. A good online guitar course is perfect if you don't have much time available and want to practice from home. Most of the time, online guitar lessons are way cheaper than private lessons. The only downside is that you don't have support, and most of your questions will be unanswered. Also, some courses can be quite slow to follow. With Acoustic Guitar Redefined, I did my best to put together a practical acoustic guitar course that will teach you how to spice things up in your playing without ""talking"" too much. In each module, you will learn how to practice, play, and then transform simple chord progressions. There are three levels for each module: The Basic level, in which I will show you how to play the chords using the fingerpicking technique. The Rhythmic level, where we will then add the percussive technique. And the Melodic level, where we will be learning a simple yet beautiful melody over the chords.

O que eu acho sensacional no seu método é que sua ênfase é na fotografia e não no Lightroom. Ao invés de usar todo tempo explicando tudo sobre a interface, os recursos e as ferramentas do Ligthroom, ele pega casos reais de imagens que precisam de algum tratamento (muito claras ou muito escuras, com muita ou pouca cor, deformadas pela lente, perspectiva errada, com muito ruído, embaçadas, etc) e mostra como trata-las, corrigindo-as, melhorando-as e deixando-as mais interessantes usando essas ferramentas, o que afinal é o propósito do software e o motivo de precisarmos dele. No processo vamos sendo apresentados ao Lightroom e aprendendo a usa-lo naturalmente.

This is hands down the best Training Course on Photoshop. I've always felt scared of learning and using Photoshop.

506,2740930,Advanced AI For Games with Goal-Oriented Action Planning,"Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an AI architecture that provides game characters with the ability to select goals and make plans to achieve those goals based on the state of the environment and available resources. It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large finite state machines. The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful. The library is written in C# and implemented in Unity V.2019, however will easily port to other applications.In this course, Penny demystifies the advanced AI technique of GOAP used for creating believable and intelligent game characters in gamesusing her internationally acclaimed teaching style andknowledge from over 25 years working with games,graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI.Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own GOAP API. You will build the entire GOAP library from the ground up while building a hospital simulation scenario in parallel, to test the API as you go.Learn how to program and work with:A GOAP Library and API that's reusable across a wide range of game projects.Goals, Actions, States and Beliefs that define the state of the game environment, what individual characters want to do and how they understand their world.Navigation Meshes and Agents that provide advanced path planning and navigation capabilities for characters.Dynamic Building of NavMeshes to allow for the repositioning of resources in the environment.Inventories for each character for use in completing tasks that satisfy character goals.The Unity UI system to move draggable resources into a game environment.Contents and OverviewThroughout the course, you will follow along while a GOAP library and API are constructed from the ground up, to allow you intimate knowledge of the codebase. Alongside this, a simple hospital simulation will be constructed to test out the functionality of the library as it is put together. The simulation will also rely on Unity's NavMesh System for navigation and path planning.The course begins with an overview of Unity's NavMesh System and covers the basic functionality needed for the hospital simulation. It then goes on to cover the concept of GOAP, where students will discover how goals, actions and plans interact. A planner will be constructed that dynamically builds each character's sequence of actions, based on what they believe their goals are while in the simulation.Following this, inventories will be introduced and developed to hold resources for individual characters. The resources in the inventories will be required for plan completion and also assist in directing a character's navigation around the environment. This will then build to the design of more complex behaviours in which two characters must collaborate to complete a plan. As the course continues, more characters with differing roles will be added and dynamically created and resources will be added and removed to develop a complex simulation. By the end of the course, students will have a hospital simulation with patients, nurses, doctors and janitors each with their own roles, goals, actions and required resources. Although this course is not about building a completed game, a final section will provide some further knowledge on Unity development and examine methods for interacting with the environment such as: dragging and dropping items, dynamic NavMesh baking, user interface creation and camera movement to provide students with some direction on how such a simulation could be turned into a game.At the completion of this course, students will have a fully-fledged GOAP library and API that they can reuse in their own game projects to provide game characters with complex intelligent behaviours.What students are saying about Penny's courses:Turns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.I honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ai_with_goap/,487,Game Development,40,39,"Penny de Byl

510,1196460,Advanced Android - Architecture with Dagger 2 and more,"Hello everyone and thank you for your interest in Advanced Android!

Android development has a lot of great benefits, such as low barrier to entry, low cost to be a published developer, and of course, being able to run your creations on millions of devices.





























Developing a maintainable and testable application that is easy to add new features to can be difficult. It requires thinking ahead about the architecture of your application and getting beyond the “just make it work” stage. This is something I personally find the most fun about development, however. My goal is to help you get into the same mindset and teach you about architecture patterns that will accomplish the previously mentioned items.





























This course is an intermediate course, so familiarity with the Android development process will help greatly. It will move quickly, but advanced concepts will be explained thoroughly. That said, we will be building an application from the very beginning, so by following along, no matter what your skill level, you will be able to complete this course and have a fully functioning Android app with the kind of architecture that you would hope to see in an enterprise level project. That’s not to say that all companies have applications with great architecture (if only we developers could be so lucky), but after this course you will be able to identify if a project doesn’t—and have an idea on how to fix it!





























Here are some of the things you will learn in this course:



























Dependency Injection with Dagger 2Making network requests with RetrofitUnit testing with Junit and MockitoUsing test doubles in Espresso tests with Dagger 2MVP / MVVM architecture (yes, a mixture! Read below for details) using Reactive View Models





























In regards to the MVP / MVVM architecture point:



























The classic software architecture patterns are baseline frameworks attempting to describe how layers of your software communicate with each other. It is important to remember that forming the patterns to what works best for you is the key; as long as you follow basic software architecture principles, any architecture is a good architecture! In this course you will learn how using Reactive View Models with Presenters can help you separate responsibilities and make your application much easier to test.





























With all that said I’m excited to get started showing you how to create applications that will make your life, and those of the developers following you, easier and more enjoyable!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/advanced-android/,467,Mobile Development,90,64,Brandon Gogetap,"Intermediate Android development experience

Students should have familiarity with writing proofs and mathematical notation.Basically just,1) Watch the videos, and try to follow along with a pencil and paper, take notes! 2) Try to learn to write the proofs as I do. If you understand the proofs then you have learned a great deal. If you can write the proofs on your own then you have really graduated to the next level.3) Repeat!If you finish even 50% of this course you will know ALOT of Advanced Calculus and more importantly your level of mathematical maturity will go up tremendously!Advanced Calculus is a beautiful yet notoriously difficult subject to learn and teach.

Depending upon the cost and model, one car can equipped from one to many ADAS functions which work to assist drivers on road and help to prevent danger situations which can cause fatal accidents. From last many years, automotive companies are working hard to bring advancement in available ADAS systems and also to develop many new. According to the SAE levels defined for Autonomous Driving vehicles, ADAS plays prominent role to develop AD technology. Hence, if you are working in automotive industry (on any profile) or you are student who is dreaming to follow your passion in this industry, then gaining insights of the ADAS systems is very important. Even though this technology is widely adapted, the literature and good explanation of major ADAS systems is rarely available at one place. When I started in Automotive Industry, I struggled a lot in my initial months, to understand and gather all the knowledge which can help me to work smoothly on the topics. In last few years, I have supervised many intern and thesis students and I had come across with the same questions by almost everyone. Even many times, people working in the industry, do not clearly understand this topic or sometimes mix one ADAS system with another and gets confused.To overcome all these issues and to help to gain knowledge in this area, I have developed this course with concise content. This course will help you to understand about their origin, their role in AD, various sensors used in ADAS, role of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in ADAS, how they are tested in Industry and explanation of more than 20 ADAS systems which includes all major ADAS available in market with animations, industrial applications and block diagrams.Kindly note that, This course is theoretical but contains lot of industrial examples to provide practical understanding of the field. It contains Quiz at the end of most of the sections to check your understanding of concepts.Course provides (completely optional) programming activities to develop and test some ADAS systems in Python. But these activities are not required to completely understand the content of this course and hence can be skipped. But if you are interested, you can give a try. Disclaimer: 1. During the course, many animations and videos from different car manufacturers are used. But they are only for education purpose and taken from sources which are available to public. I have no intention to market any kind of Technology through this course. 2.

Advanced Excelusers, always find the optimal solution for every task, and they find it fast!What differentiates this Microsoft Excelcourse from the others?The reason I created this specific Advanced Excel course,is because there are many advanced Excel users who are unaware ofkey features  formulas in Excel. I understand that when you take an Excel training it can be so broad, and a lot of courses cover too many topics. It’s easy to get lost. You might also not immediately appreciate why some features are useful and how you can practically apply them. We are creatures of habit and it’s difficult to get our head around learning new techniques. As a result you might be missing out on some features that can majorly simplify the way you use Excel.Differentiation factor #1Focus - The top 10 brings focus to the key Excel features which will provide you with a solid  a strong foundation in Excel. Differentiation factor #2Learn by doing - This Advanced Microsoft Excel courseis well structured and organized.

525,1322060,"Advanced Excel Power Query-M language, troubleshoot, Pattern","Hello and welcome to Excel Power Query Advanced course.At the outset I thank you for showing interest in this course.

 In this video I will provide overview of all the contents of this course and what are basic requirements before you enroll into this course. So let’s get started.

 There are four major areas I will be covering as part of this course. The first one is for troubleshooting the Power Query errors and workaround for limitation of Power Query. In real any software is not foolproof and has its own limitation. Also, if you don’t use the software as programmed you may encounter errors. And I hope you would agree that error codes or description in most of the software are not that user friendly or they do not provide appropriate solution to resolve the error. Hence in this first section I will show some of the common areas where you face Power Query limitation and erros. Some of them are as follows:

 Error encountered with adding / rename / deleting a particular column headings.

 Handling null values during arithmetic calculation.

 Identify error rows encountered while creating or on refresh of query.

 Multiplying effect when you JOIN queries

 Issues with filters and how to use advanced filters.

 Then the next area is for advanced case studies. Similar to my starter course of Excel Power Query where I have shown you more than 20+ real life case studies of applying power query, here also I have taken some real life case studies which require some more in depth knowledge of Power Query and workaround. This section will be updated new case studies as and when I see some interesting datasets. The current video are related to 

 Applying local setting when converting the dates fields

 Leave dataset which needed leave details to be broken into separate rows from a single cell.

 Unstack the dataset which has uneven details

 Combine multiple rows data back to single cell.

 Then next section is for advanced M concepts. Here I will give you more information related to M Language in Power Query. What syntax is to be used under advanced editor. How to create parameters and use it inside your power query. How to create new custom M function using PQ interface or through advanced editor. I will also show how you can troubleshoot the custom M function you have created using advanced editor. Then I will show you how you can organize your multiple queries in separate groups. Further I will also show how to use Query Dependency view which will give you visual presentation of all the queries inside your excel file. This will help you understand the flow of all the data from source till the final output, where it is loaded or which queries are referenced to each other. All precedents and dependents to your queries can be easily identified.

 And now finally in last section I will be providing some readymade patterns for power query. I will provide all the power query code which you can copy paste into your file and start using it. You will not need to create any new query for these patterns. Since creating these patterns using power query requires lot of efforts and also very complex I am providing you these as ready to use.

 So now before you enroll I would like to tell you that there are few requirements.

 First one is that you should have latest version of Power Query installed if you are using Excel 2010 / 2013 or if you are using Excel 2016 then it should be updated.

557,3784430,Advanced SQL Database Administration with MySQL Workbench,"MySQL is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing relational databases, and a skill that every analyst and BI professional should have in the arsenal. In this course, you'll take your database administration skills to the next level, expanding into advanced concepts like replication, automation, and database security.We'll start by introducing the course structure, installing MySQL Community and Workbench, and reviewing key database administration (DBA) tasks; creating and editing schemas  tables, inserting and deleting records, and reviewing the key principles of normalized databases. From there we'll work through more advanced concepts like replication, backup and recovery, and learn how to leverage automation via stored procedures, triggers, and scheduled events. Throughout the course, you'll be playing the role of Lead Database Administrator for an e-commerce startup, and learn how to build and populate an entire database from the ground up using real-world projects and assignments.COURSEOUTLINE:SQLIntro MySQLSetupFor students who haven't completed one of our other SQL courses, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQLCommunity Server MySQLWorkbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac  PC, and run our first piece of SQLcode to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.Importing Data to the Database We'll quickly review some basic concepts like creating, inserting, and deleting records. Then we'll learn how to tackle large data imports with ease, using the table data import wizard. We'll be using this handy tool throughout the course. You will construct and populate a database from the ground up as the business grows, just like a real DBAas part of the course project. Altering, Updating Mapping KeysWe'll briefly review critical concepts like altering tables and updating records, discuss the ins and outs of primary and foreign keys, and from there you'll jump right into your assignments and quizzes for this section. Replication, Backup RecoveryHere we'll introduce the critical DBAconcepts of replication, backup and recovery. We'll discuss the various benefits of replication, different methods of backing up your databases, and you'll learn how to restore your data should the need arise. This is getting into some pretty serious stuff!***MID-COURSEPROJECTYou will need all of the skills you've learned so far to complete this hands on mid-course project. You'll help your CEO by enhancing the data structure to accommodate changing business needs, and insert new data into various places within your database. Trigger AutomationHere we'll dive into one of the most powerful automation tools you'll use as a DBA...triggers!You'll learn how you can create triggers to look for changes in the database via create, update, and delete statements, and then automatically enact changes on one of more of your tables. Triggers will be your best friend as a DBA, and can be extremely handy for Analysts to understand as well. Creating ViewsSometimes you don't need to create a table, and a view (aka ""a virtual table)is a better option. We'll walk through what views are, how you create them, and some of the major benefits of using views in certain situations. The EERDiagram EditorOne of the best tools at your disposal for understanding your database and communicating its structure to others in your organization is leveraging EERDiagrams. We'll review some of the basics that we discussed in the Beginner course, and we'll also learn how to use the EERDiagram Editor to reverse engineer your schema, which is an extremely handy tool!Stored Procedures Scheduled EventsNext, we'll dive deeper into automation by learning how to create stored procedures and scheduled events. If you liked triggers, you're going to love these!You can use stored procedures to simplify your processes, make your code more modular and easier to understand, and centralize certain parts of complex queries that you can leverage throughout your organization. Scheduled events will allow you to run one-time or recurring processes on your database, which you can schedule on whatever cadence you want. These are really fun!Automating Data from Website ActivityHere we'll be talking about the different types of data businesses typically track from their website activity, including traffic source data, on-site behavior, product purchases, and more. We'll discuss the various methods used to capture the various data types, and discuss the DBA's role in partnering with Engineering to make sure this is all working as it should. Database SecurityIn the last section before the final project, we'll discuss some of the most common types of database security threats you should be aware of as a DBA, as well as security best practices to mitigate your risk. Again, we'll discuss the DBA's role in the organization, how a DBAwill partner with Engineering here, and who typically owns what. ***FINALCOURSEPROJECTThis hands-on project will test all of your DBAskills. You will need to alter tables, import lots of data, design an optimal structure for an entirely new set of tables for a new business initiative, create an EERDiagram describing your new tables, and then you'll actually create them. After that, you'll need to create a stored procedure and a view, which will both used for reporting on the new data the company will be collecting.Finally, you'll need to come up with a comprehensive security plan to make sure your organization is aware of threats and following best practices. Iknow this sounds like a lot, but at this point you'll be ready for it!IMPORTANTNOTE:This course does NOTgo deep on data exploration and database analysis.

Good course."" -- Mike H""Excellent material and quick to the point!""-- Nick Y. COURSEINTRODUCTION:Welcome to Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis.  In this course, we are going to take a deep dive into analyzing the transaction log. The SQL Server transaction log contains the history of every action that modified anything in the database. Before data is written or saved on disk a copy or record of that transaction is first written to the transaction log.  This is part of the D in the ACID properties. Recall that D stands for durability and durability is the ACID property which guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently.  For example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes. This process in SQL Server is accomplished by WAL or Write Ahead Logging.  SQL Server uses a write-ahead log (WAL), which guarantees that no data modifications are written to disk before the associated log record is written to disk. No matter what you’ve read about non-logged operations the truth is that every user transactions that modifies an internal SQL Server object is logged.  In the course we will learn how WAL works for SQL Srever and some internal architecture on how this is accomplished.  Thanks for your interest in Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis and we will see you in the course.

If you are a passionate Tableau user and you can associate yourself with one or more of the questions above, then this course is for you. Scenarios like the ones mentioned above occur on a daily basis, and they can cause quite a bit of headache for the analyst. Tableau has many great tools and functions including table calculations that make everyday life easier for the data scientist.



One strong point of the software is its responsiveness. Plotting measures against variables has never been easier: each change to the shelves is instantly and automatically applied on the view - a great environment to interact with the data.

  This strong point, however, can easily be turned into a weakness, if you want your analysis to step out of the borders of the view level of detail.



In Tableau, to solve classic analytical problems (such as cohort analysis, retention analysis or binning aggregates by dimensions), or to proceed with special filtering scenarios (like proportional brushing or relative comparisons) you need to be familiar with a special tool set called the level of detail (LOD) expressions.



In this course, you will learn about the general mechanics of LOD expressions both in theory and practice. We start from the very basics and then we proceed to more advanced techniques in a stepwise manner. If you are not familiar with the concept of LOD expressions yet, but you are already a Tableau user, then taking this course will most probably improve your analytical skills and broaden your tool set.



After completing this course, you will be able to solve all above mentioned analytical challenges and even more, because LOD expressions let the analyst come up with creative solutions for custom scenarios. Instead of asking the questions you can be the one in the office who always has a practical answer or a constructive idea. Take a look at the content of this course, and I bet you won’t regret it.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/advanced-tableau-level-of-detail-expressions-tableau-lod/,373,Analytics Data Visualization,45,44,R-Tutorials Training,"Basic understanding of Tableau

565,2475998,Advanced Training for Trauma Treatment of Complex PTSD,"Presenter: Dr. J. Eric Gentry, Ph.D., LMHC, D.A.A.E.T.S.While the focus of the CCTS-I was to acquire the basic skills for treating post traumatic stress, the focus of the Complex PTSD training is acquiring skills for effectively treating those challenging clients with complex post traumatic stress, or C-PTSD. C-PTSD can present with a myriad of difficult symptoms including intense abreactions/flashbacks; severe “depression-like” shutdown and avoidance; dissociation; relational difficulties and challenges; chronic emotional and somatic dysregulation; chronic pain; and psychotic symptoms. This course provides comprehensive presentation of clinical skills for screening/assessing, stabilizing, skills-building, and treating complex post traumatic stress in all its challenging presentations. Focusing upon working in a tri-phasic model, the participant will learn how to titrate treatment to minimize discomfort and crises while, at once, accelerating treatment gains in early, mid and latter stages of treatment. The course provides a balance of current evidence/science-based interventions and protocols paired with experiential practice wisdom from clinicians who have successfully worked with population for decades. Participants completing this course will discover a newfound sense of competency and excitement for working with these clients who, in the past, have baffled even seasoned clinicians.Learning Objectives1. Articulate the differences between simple and complex PTSD (C-PTSD) and identify the distinct challenges for diagnosis, treatment planning, stabilization and treatment of C-PTSD.2. Understand the neurobiology of C-PTSD and how chronic exposure to threatening environments can produce the spectrum of symptoms of C-PTSD3. Appreciate the role that attachment trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) play in risk for and creation of C-PTSD; and how successfully addressing attachment issues can accelerate treatment for C-PTSD.4. Articulate the causes of attachment trauma (e.g., relational threat/anxious attachment; avoidant attachment; disorganized attachment) and how these adaptations are easily misunderstood as personality disorders.5. Articulate the importance of neuroplasticity/pruning and understanding neuronal sequencing (i.e., “neural networks”) in treating C-PTSD and all post traumatic conditions.6. Understand the important role that conditioned threat response and subsequent ANS dysregulation play in generating and sustaining the symptoms of all post traumatic conditions including C-PTSD.7. Expanded knowledge of the science and applicability of Porges’ Polyvagal Theory to treatment with C-PTSD; specifically the importance of developing and utilizing healthy attachment relationships to augment treatment.8. Articulate and explain how dissociation symptoms (e.g., numbing; derealization; depersonalization; hearing “voices”; fractured multiple ego-states; dissociative identity) are adaptations to recurring (usually developmental) trauma.9. Identify evidence-based pharmacological interventions for stabilization and treatment for clients with C-PTSD.10. Apply Herman’s Tri-Phasic Model to conceptualization, titration and delivery of treatment for C- PTSD.11. Identify specific assessment and treatment tasks for each of the three phases of the Tri-Phasic Model.12. Understand symptoms of C-PTSD as adaptations to ongoing developmental trauma that can include extreme symptoms including self-injury; suicide; dissociation; numbing; addiction (process and substance); eating disordered behavior; chronic  intractable depression; hyper/hypo sexuality; and rage.13. Articulate the role of crucial non-specific factors of positive expectancy and therapeutic relationship using Feedback Informed Therapy (FIT) as central focus of treatment with C-PTSD.14. Learn and appreciate the pivotal role of psychoeducation in treating C-PTSD to help survivors to begin to honor their survival, ameliorate shame and move towards self-compassion.15. Learn and implement the four “common factors/active ingredients” shared by all effective trauma therapies for clients with C-PTSD.16. Appreciate the ubiquitous role of reciprocal inhibition embedded in all evidence-based trauma therapiesSkillsPreparation/Assessment/Treatment Planning/Relationship-Building1. Master self-regulation of ANS dysregulation (i.e., anxiety) for clinician resilience and optimization of treatment delivery.2. Become intentional with maximizing positive expectancy as crucial early treatment intervention for engagement and ongoing intervention to enhance outcomes.3. Informed Consent for C-PTSD4. Develop understanding and usage of various assessment tools5. First-session Interventions to enhance safety, stabilization, positive expectancy and therapeutic relationship6. Skilled implementation of Feedback Informed Therapy using Miller’s Session Rating ScaleStage I: Safety  Stabilization1. Enhance case-management skills to facilitate and co-author safety planning interventions with clients in current danger.2. Practice psychoeducational skills to help C-PTSD clients discern difference between real vs. perceived threat then coaching skills to avoid “real” danger and confront perceived threats with self-regulation (i.e, in vivo exposure).3. Develop mastery of psychoeducation/cognitive restructuring skills for reframing symptoms from shame and affliction to “over”-adaptation.4. Develop mastery for teaching and coaching self-regulation skills for clients to down-regulate negative arousal, achieve stability and begin in vivo exposure in early treatment.5. Gain generic stabilization skills for all C-PTSD clientsStage II: Remembrance  Mourning/Trauma Resolution1. Master skills for Direct Therapeutic Exposure using reciprocal inhibition with in vivo exposure as primary means for resolving symptoms in Criteria B (Intrusion), Criterion C (Avoidance), Criterion D (Negative Alterations of Cognition Mood)  Criterion E (Arousal  Reactivity) of PTSD.2. Discover CBT skills to lessen avoidance, arousal, shame, dysphoria, reactivity, and distorted thinking symptoms.3. Compare evidence-based/evidence-informed treatments currently utilized to address symptoms of C-PTSDStage III: Reconnection1. Identification of specific treatment goals and empirical markers for objectives in this final stage of treatment. This stage requires a new and additional treatment plan.2.

594,1835854,After Effects para Motion designers: Do zero ao mercado,"Eu sei que o After effects parece assustador à primeira vista. Já estive no seu lugar. Acredite, esse programa poderoso não é difícil, mas se você estudá-lo com a abordagem incorreta ele pode se tornar um labirinto monstruoso. Hoje com quase 9 anos de experiência, esse monstro foi domesticado. Mas não foi fácil,  a maioria dos cursos que eu participava não tinham uma estratégia de didática adequada. Muitos deles na maioria das vezes focavam apenas em descrever o programa de cabo a rabo sem nenhuma prática associada aos conceitos ensinados. Esse modelo de ensino, no final das contas, apenas entulhava a minha cabeça, consumia a minha energia de maneira ineficaz e me deixava desanimado para seguir em frente.Percebi que para conseguir aprender esse programa fantástico teria que desenvolver a minha própria estratégia. É justamente esse método que eu estou abrindo aqui. Esse curso foi formulado totalmente baseado nessa didática que eu desenvolvi. Funcionou perfeitamente comigo e vai funcionar para você. Graças a essa abordagem, hoje atendo clientes do mundo todo e empresas de grande porte, inclusive algumas que estão na lista da FORBES das maiores empresas do mundo.Como será?A ideia desse curso é ensinar a ferramenta com um direcionamento para a demanda do mercado real! Eu quero que você termine o curso e já esteja preparado para sair à caça de trabalho. Por isso a ideia é que ao final você tenha o seu próprio demoreel (portfolio) com os tipos de videos mais solicitados do mercado. Pois todo cliente antes de te contratar vai pedir que você mostre algum material seu que se assemelhe ao que ele está precisando. Sem ter o que mostrar, não tem cliente.Mas não se preocupe, a cada módulo vamos produzir uma categoria de animação escolhida de acordo com os tipos de animação com maior demanda no mercado: KinectType (animação com textos), whiteboard, animação de logo, animação de personagem básico e avançado, Infográficos, Vfx. Bônus:Além de tudo isso, ao final do curso vou te presentear com um bônus incrível: ""Como conseguir clientes de qualquer lugar do mundo, receber em dólar e trabalhar da sua casa"". Nesse módulo eu vou passar todo o método e estratégia que eu uso para captar clientes globais e trabalhar remotamente. Esse curso reúne tudo o que eu aprendi ao longo de 9 anos nesse mercado. Vou passar o melhor caminho para você driblar todos os erros que eu cometi.

596,2174090,After Effects: Animando Personagens do Zero ao Mercado,"Esse curso tem como objetivo central te ensinar do absoluto ZERO, como se anima personagens dentro do after effects. Nós vamos focar  nas técnicas da base essencial para você começar no mundo do motion design e aprender uma das animações mais pedidas, bem pagas e divertidas de se fazer.Esse curso é composto por 4 módulos focado nas 4 técnicas da base da animação de personagem. Cada uma delas vai ensinar como animar tipos diferentes de personagens. Combinadas elas vão te permitir animar uma infinidade de estilos desse tipo de animação.E não se preocupa que nós vamos começar do absoluto zero. Nós vamos ilustrar juntos os personagens no illustrator. Preparar ele para ser animado. Vou te mostrar como importar no after effects. Organizar o seu projeto da forma mais correta, eficiente e profissional. E finalmente em seguida vou te mostrar como animar o seu personagem.No módulo 01 nós vamos aprender animação com shapes. Uma técnica bem simples mas que você vai ver que só com ela, você já consegue animar muita coisa. Inclusive até já poderia vender para algum cliente.No módulo 02, nós vamos animar um personagem inteiro usando apenas rotação. Isso vai ampliar o seu repertório de animações, te tornando capaz de pegar uma quantidade ainda maior de tipos de trabalho.No módulo 03, nós vamos seguir para o walkcilcle ou, traduzindo, o ciclo de caminhada. Que vai te ensinar a animar um personagem andando. Essa técnica tem fama de ser muito difícil, mas nesse módulo eu vou te mostrar que não é um bicho de sete cabeças. E ao final você conseguirá animar um personagem andando sem problema algum!No módulo 4, eu já vou te ensinar a usar a mesma ferramenta que grandes profissionais da área usam: o DUIK. Depois desse módulo você verá o quanto essa ferramenta vai facilitar e evoluir o resultado do seu trabalho. Depois desses 4 módulo dificilmente você vai negar um cliente por não saber animar um personagemVou revelar todo o meu fluxo de trabalho. A forma mais eficiênte de você criar e animar um personagem.Outro ponto importante é que eu fiz questão de explicar o porquê de cada passo. Com isso você não vai apenas repetir, como nos tutoriais de youtube, você vai entender o raciocínio por detrás. O que vai te dar a capacidade de criar produzir o que vier na sua mente.Nesse curso eu fiz questão de escolher apenas animações que tenham valor de mercado. Isso significa que tudo que você aprender aqui, desde do primeiro módulo, já tem alguém querendo pagar por aquele tipo de animação. Diferente de outros cursos que ensinam coisas mirabolantes que que você nunca vai ver um cliente pedindo.Então em resumo, eu preparei esse curso aqui para que você não cometesse os erros mais comuns, que foram os meus erros também, de quem quer tentar aprender animação de personagens. Tudo que você aprender nesse curso, tem valor de mercado. Você vai aprender técnicas que são pedidas no mercado real. Eu quis projetar o meu curso assim, por que é mais estimulante para quem está aprendendo, saber que aquele tempo e dinheiro investido vai trazer um retorno financeiro. E é isso que eu mais quero para você, que depois desse curso, ou durante mesmo, você já saia conquistando clientes pra todo lado!Mas você, assim como eu ficava quando terminava um curso de AE, deve está se perguntando como faz para começar a pegar clientes. Por isso, eu decidi incluir nesse curso um BÔNUS onde eu vou te entregar todo o meu método e estratégia para conseguir clientes do mundo todo, receber em dollar e trabalhar de onde quiser! Eu vou abrir para você o meu segredo de ter liberdade e trabalhar com o que gosta! Mas não adianta saber como pegar clientes e não ter um demoreel, traduzindo, um portfolio. E aí eu entro em outro ponto importante que muitos dos meus alunos se sentem inseguros de fazer por conta própria. E com razão, eu passei exatamente por essa situação. Então eu preparei um segundo bônus. Nele eu vou te passar todos os macetes de se montar um bom portfólio. Todas as boas práticas e cuidados que você deve ter ao montar a ferramenta principal na hora de conquistar um cliente.Você verá o quanto vai valer a pena aprender esse tipo de animação. Uma das minhas maiores dores no coração era negar trabalhos super bem pagos por não ter determinação de aprender animação de personagem. Depois desse curso isso não vai acontecer com você.Você simplesmente acabará esse curso dominando um dos tipos de animação mais pedidas, bem pagas e divertidas de se fazer no mundo do motion design.Bom é isso pessoal! Você está diante de uma oportunidade de aprender animação de personagem da melhor forma possível. Esse curso vai te fazer evitar todos os erros que eu cometi. De forma enxuta e direta você vai sair desse curso dominando o essencial para começar a fazer dinheiro com esse tipo  animação. Agora a escolha está nas suas mãos, seguir por conta própria ou aprender com quem já conhece o caminho.É isso, espero te ver lá dentro do curso!

Learn to See Agile and Waterfall in a fresh new perspecttve as complementary to each other rather than competitiveMany businesses and project managers are faced with a choice of choosing a traditional plan-driven approach (or what is sometimes called “Waterfall"") or a more Agile approach for critical projects which can be a very important decision with significant business impact. However, there are many stereotypes and misconceptions that exist about both “Agile"" and “Waterfall"" that can be very confusing and misleading. As an example, many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project.Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions and:Develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about ""Agile versus Waterfall"".See these two approaches in a fresh new perspective as complementary to each other rather than competitive2. Learn how to blend the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation to get the best of both worldsRather than force-fitting a project to one of these extremes, a much better approach is to fit the methodology to the nature of the project. Sometimes that requires blending the two approaches together in the right proportions to fit the situation to get the best of both worlds. It takes more skill to do that but it definitely can be done.____________________________________________________________________________​Overall Agile Business Management Curriculum:This course is part of an overall curriculum designed for business people to effectively participate and lead in an Agile environment. Agile significantly changes the role of business people in leading and managing projects and requires a much more active business leadership role to guide the direction of projects that are in progress. The overall curriculum consists of three primary courses:​1. Agile BM 101 - Introduction to Agile Business Management (this course)This course povides a solid foundation for the other courses in this overall curriculum and helps all business personnel develop a solid understanding of how to implement a hybrid approach that blends the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation2. Agile BM 201 - Mastering Agile Business ManagementThis course is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile/Scrum projects for anyone in a Product Owner role or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The Product Owner role in Agile is not well understood and many business managers who are assigned to perform that role are not well-prepared for it.3. Agile BM 301 - Enterprise-level Agile Business ManagementThe final course in this series is focused on advanced topics related to applying Agile to a business at an enterprise level includingAlignment and Value DisciplinesEnterprise-level frameworks (SAFe and DAD)Enterprise-level Agile TransformationsOrganizational Culture and Change Management____________________________________________________________________________Why Is This Curriculum Important?In a traditional, plan-driven project management environment,A large part of the management of a project can be delegated to a project manager, andOnce the business requirements for the project are documented and approved by the business, the business role in providing leadership and management of the project can be limited.In an Agile environment,The requirements and the design of the solution evolve and are further refined as the project progressesFor that reason, it is essential that the business is much more directly involved in providing leadership and direction to the project as it progressesIn order to provide effective leadership and direction to projects, the business people who are either directly or indirectly involved in Agile projects need to fully understand how the process works in order to participate collaboratively in the process with the project teams who are responsible for developing the solution.Many existing courses for business people in an Agile environment such as Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are limited to the ""mechanics"" of how to do Agile and are limited to a pure Agile approach.

608,1352388,Agile Business Analysis,"Business Analysts have a wide range of feelings about Agile.

Some love it. It’s a fast and nimble way to develop products, and you can be very productive in relatively little time.







Others hate it, because it is radically different from traditional control-oriented project approaches, and they struggle to understand their value and role when documentation takes a back seat.







And many others like the idea of Agile, but realize that it’s a tricky thing to get right – especially with very large organizations which have documentation and processes deeply engrained in their cultures.













If any of these statements sounds familiar, we designed this course for you.

  









There is a lot of training out there for agile teams, but agile BAs have very specific needs that haven’t been addressed… (until now)









That’s why we developed this course – to give you a basis on which to build an excellent BA career in any agile environment.

  









In this clear, concise, and easy-to-follow course, you will learn:

  









How to figure out what your role on the team needs to be

  What user stories and acceptance criteria really are – and it’s probably not what you think

  When to write requirements to maximize efficiency and minimize re-work

  Why the traditional product backlog is a mess and how to overcome it

  What a typical BA does in the course of a day, sprint, and release

  (and a whole lot more)

  









… all while learning the ropes from a seasoned expert and business analysis executive.

  









By the end of the course, you’ll have more than just knowledge… You’ll have the practice and practical experience you need to feel confident on the job.

613,3704956,Agile Kanban: Kanban for Software Development Teams,"Kanban is not a software development lifecycle methodology or an approach to project management.It requires that some process is already in place so that Kanban can be applied toincrementally change the underlying process.—David Anderson, KanbanKanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!This course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.We will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.We will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.Here is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:Introduction to Kanban  Kanban BoardFinding Inefficiencies in the ProcessLimiting Work in ProgressUnder utilization of ResourcesUnequal Sized TasksMarking the TasksOther Inefficiencies/IssuesKanban PracticesDefining DoneDaily Stand upSpecifying RulesKey Agile ConceptsUnderstanding  Creating User Stories, Theme  EpicWhat is Product BacklogDifference between Product Backlog  Product RoadmapAdvantages  Disadvantages of AgileHow Estimation is done in AgileWhy Relative Estimation in AgileT-Shirt  Fibonacci EstimationPlaning Poker in AgileUnderstanding  Creating Burn down Charts Minimum Viable ProductTeam VelocityThis course is ideal for software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.No prior experience is necessary to take this course. So, if even if you don’t know what Kanban is and the various principles and concepts under Kanban and Agile Project Management, not to worry.We will cover all of these concepts from scratch.Course enrollment grants you lifetime access to all the the entire course content including quizzes, practice exercises etc. In addition, you’ll also receive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up. And this all comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee! You have nothing to lose and so much knowledge to gain.I hope that you will enjoy the course, be challenged by it and learn a lot. The primary objective is to build a strong foundational knowledge of the principles of Kanban  Agile.It is suggested that you go through the course at a pace that makes sense for you. The topics build on each other, so it is better to slow down and really learn something than to just move on in order to keep up a certain pace. So, I have the tools needed to get the job done.

Many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project. Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions, develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about ""Agile versus Waterfall"".

That doesn't mean that traditional plan-driven project methodologies are obsolete and no longer useful; however, within a relatively short amount of time, a project manager who only knows how to use traditional plan-driven methodologies will be at a serious disadvantage in the job market.That's a big challenge for many project managers who have been schooled and indoctrinated in a plan-driven project management approach because Agile changes the very nature of how we do project management in many environments.

« Il n’y a rien de plus pratique qu’une bonne théorie », disait Kurt Lewin. Surtout quand cette théorie est le fait d’un praticien. Pendant plus de trente ans, Jacques Chaize s’est attaché avec succès à construire une entreprise agile, capable d’initier le changement plutôt que de le subir. Il s’est aussi attaché, à travers des livres et conférences, à formaliser, synthétiser, théoriser sans jargon ce qu’il fait et ce qui marche.
Dans un langage clair, il nous livre ici la quintessence de ce qui dans l’action permet à une entreprise de prendre en main son développement. Un témoignage exceptionnel dans le canevas de quelques règles de succès applicables.



À propos de l’auteur



Jacques Chaize





Jacques Chaize a consacré l’essentiel de sa carrière à diriger et développer des entreprises industrielles en France et dans le monde. Son expérience de dirigeant l’a conduit à mettre en place des organisations en réseau, à initier les premières démarches apprenantes et, plus récemment, à les conjuguer avec succès aux pratiques de lean management.
Président de Danfoss Water Controls depuis 1997 jusqu’à la cession réussie de l’entreprise à un groupe industriel coté en 2011, Jacques Chaize continue sa carrière d’entrepreneur indépendant.
Il a par ailleurs présidé le Centre des jeunes dirigeants (CJD) de 1988 à 1990, le Medef de Saône-et-Loire et de Bourgogne entre 1997 et 2003. Co-fondateur de l’association SOL-France pour le développement des organisations apprenantes, il a été Président de l’Association Progrès du Management (APM) de 2007 à 2010.
Jacques Chaize a décrit ses expériences dans plusieurs ouvrages : La Porte du changement s’ouvre de l’intérieur (Calmann Lévy, 1992) et Le Grand Ecart (Village Mondial, 1998). En 2007, il a coordonné Repenser l’Entreprise (Cherche Midi), un ouvrage collectif rassemblant des experts de toutes disciplines autour des enjeux de l’entreprise. En 2017, co-auteur de « The Lean Strategy » (McGrawHill-New York) à paraître en France début 2018.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/agile-lean-libere-les-cles-pour-transformer-votre-entreprise/,33,Agile & Scrum,15,14,albert académie,Aucun pré-requis,"Comment rendre votre entreprise agile

644,4231438,AI for Business - AI Applications for Business Success,"AI for Business – AI Applications for Business SuccessAI isn’t just a fancy concept that powers self-driving vehicles, robots, and high-tech companies.Most organizations – regardless of their size and industry – can benefit from the application of artificial intelligence.Charts and dashboards are useful tools, but they often struggle to analyze big and complex datasets. This is precisely when AI outperforms the traditional Business Intelligence approach! Correlation doesn’t imply causation, and this is a significant limitation of BI.Artificial Intelligence can help a company in a variety of ways – it can be employed to build customer retention models, increase gross revenue by optimizing your selling price, find a way to minimize costs and optimize business processes, and ultimately – to run an organization more effectively.This is what AI for Business course aims to teach you.Your instructor, Horia Margarit, has earned two Bachelor’s degrees in Cognitive and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master's degree in Statistics from Stanford University. With over 10 years of professional experience in the San Francisco Bay Area, he has differentiated himself by applying highly novel methods and approaches to tackling complex business problems. As a result, his predictions for business applications of AI have been featured in both CIO Magazine and Forbes. Horia’s primary focus is on technical underpinnings that maximize actual business and customer value.All this makes him uniquely qualified to teach this topic.In the course, you’ll get an overview of business analytics and find out how to define SMART goals and conduct SWOT analysis. You’ll go through the challenges and opportunities of supply chain analytics to then determine the business problem we’ll tackle throughout the course.Moreover, we will consider the key benefits and limitations of using business analytics approach to solving such problems.Having laid the foundations, we’ll then dig deeper and focus on attainability. Even more so, you will discover how to leverage the power of AI in order to achieve the set business goals.Here, you will be able to:· Build an AI model from high fidelity data· Extract actionable explanations· Predict the outcome· Evaluate the quality of the predictionsWe won’t spend too much time obtaining the data and building the AI model. Instead, we will focus on evaluating the performance of those methods.For that, you will go through key algorithms like Gradient Boosted Machines and Convergent Cross Mapping. Most of all, you will have the chance to examine in great detail novel approaches to understanding model performance such as LIME and SHAP values.And that’s not all!After we’ve learned how to obtain accurate predictions from our models, we’ll find out how we can show the significance of the obtained results. To do so, we’ll rely on parametric tests. More specifically, we will be working with the hybrid experiment and quantile difference tests.Take your AI career to new heights!This course is packed with valuable concepts and state-of-the-art techniques.Enroll now and start your journey to AI for business today!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ai-for-business-ai-applications-for-business-success/,135,Analytics,28,26,365 Careers,"You should have some rudimentary knowledge of higher level mathematics

This AJAX for beginner's tutorial course will teach you what AJAX is and how to start using it with PHP to create excellent web applications.

---------------------------------------------------------

Hands on project

On this course we will create a real AJAX application that will give you the skills you need to start implementing AJAX to your projects or start you on your web development journey.

----------------------------------------------------------

AJAX is all around us, just type something in the UDEMY search bar and you will automatically see words appear in the input; that's AJAX in action.

Do you need AJAX? I think the question should be, do you want your applications or websites to be awesome? Or course we do, right? YES.

I don't like to show off, but my students love me, and I love them, here are some of the reviews I get.

The Best Teacher ever  

Edwin Diaz i am a newbie and now i am writing php syntax :D awesome and your lectures and jokes are awesome. They help me to motivate and learn by doing :).

Groovy Goodness

If code is boring you to death or you wonder just what the buzz about Bootstrap, then hold on and take a ride with Edwin in this fun and very informative class. Clear, professional quality. I dare you not to smile after taking this class.

FANTASTIC!!

You're a very good teacher, you made it very simple and easy to understand, thank you so much, I want to learn more about bootstrap because the course was too short, but anyway great job. Sorry for my English, I'm Spanish. bye bye

Awesome

I really like listening to the instructor. He is easy to follow, and his lesson what to the point.



My Promise

I will do my best to teach you AJAX and to answer your questions promptly.

Your $$$$ invested in this course will be multiplied over and over again.

AJAX it's a super hot technology right now and having it in your toolbox will separate you from the rest of those developers out there that don't know it.

100% Money Back if you don't like it

Don't you love this? If for some reason you don't like the course within 30 days, Udemy will return your money and no hard feelings from me.

Are you still reading? What are you waiting for? Join now and learn AJAX the easy way.

The answer is simple: Ajax.  You’ve probably heard of it, but you’ve always wondered “What is Ajax”? Ajax is simply Asynchronous Javascript and XML. By taking our Ajax course, you can make pages on your web application respond quickly, and with a minimum of screen refreshes.With our Ajax course and a little Javascript knowledge you can use Ajax to take database information and store, alter, sort and conditionally format it all on the client side.  This minimizes the load on your server and makes your applications respond quickly and without reloading the HTML page.  Ajax communicates with the server behind the scenes while your user continues to use your web site, accessing the information they want. Our course will show you numerous Ajax examples and help you become proficient in using Ajax.In our Ajax course, master trainer Mark Lassoff takes you through the basics of Ajax right to advanced topics like parsing JSON responses from web services.  Our Ajax course is recommended for all web developers who want to improve their client side skills, and make professional, fast and responsive web applications.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ajax-development/,178,Web Development,23,17,"Framework Tech Media

679,3395102,"Algorithmic Trading A-Z with Python, Machine Learning & AWS","Welcome to the most comprehensive Algorithmic Trading Course. It´s the first 100% Data-driven Trading Course!In this rigorous but yet practical Course, we will leave nothing to chance, hope, vagueness, or pure intuition! Did you know that 75% of retail Traders lose money with Day Trading? (some sources say 95%)For me as a Data Scientist and experienced Finance Professional this is not a surprise. Day Traders typically do not know/follow the five fundamental rules of (Day) Trading. This Course covers them all in detail!1. Know and understand the Day Trading BusinessDon´t start Trading if you are not familiar with terms like Bid-Ask Spread, Pips, Leverage, Margin Requirement, Half-Spread Costs, etc.Part 1 of this course is all about Day Trading A-Z with the Brokers Oanda and FXCM. It deeply explains the mechanics, terms, and rules of Day Trading (covering Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Baskets, and more).2. Use powerful and unique Trading StrategiesYou need to have a Trading Strategy. Intuition or gut feeling is not a successful strategy in the long run (at least in 99.9% of all cases). Relying on simple Technical Rules doesn´t work either because everyone uses them.You will learn how to develop more complex and unique Trading Strategies with Python. We will combine simple and also more complex Technical Indicators and we will also create Machine Learning- and Deep Learning- powered Strategies. The course covers all required coding skills (Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) from scratch in a very practical manner. 3. Test your Strategies before you invest real money (Backtesting / Forward Testing)Is your Trading Strategy profitable? You should rigorously test your strategy before 'going live'.This course is the most comprehensive and most rigorous Backtesting / Forward Testing course that you can find.You will learn how to apply Vectorized Backtesting techniques, Iterative Backtesting techniques (event-driven), live Testing with play money, and more. And I will explain the difference between Backtesting and Forward Testing and show you what to use when. The backtesting techniques and frameworks covered in the course can be applied to long-term investment strategies as well! 4. Take into account Trading Costs - it´s all about Trading Costs!""Trading with zero commissions? Great!"" ... Well, there is still the Bid-Ask-Spread and even if 2 Pips seem to be very low, it isn´t! The course demonstrates that finding profitable Trading Strategies before Trading Costs is simple. It´s way more challenging to find profitable Strategies after Trading Costs! Learn how to include Trading Costs into your Strategy and into Strategy Backtesting / Forward Testing. And most important: Learn how you can control and reduce Trading Costs. 5. Automate your TradesManual Trading is error-prone, time-consuming, and leaves room for emotional decision-making. This course teaches how to implement and automate your Trading Strategies with Python, powerful Broker APIs and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Create your own Trading Bot and fully automate/schedule your trading sessions in the AWS Cloud! Finally... this is more than just a course on automated Day Trading:the techniques and frameworks covered can be applied to long-term investing as well.it´s an in-depth Python Course that goes beyond what you can typically see in other courses. Create Software with Python and run it in real-time on a virtual Server (AWS)!we will feed Machine Learning  Deep Learning Algorithms with real-time data and take ML/DL-based actions in real-time!

684,2028392,Algorithms and Data Structures in C#: Complete Tutorial,"Whylearn about data structures and algorithms? Algorithms and data structures constitute the fundamentals of programming.Good understanding of algorithms and data structures is one of the most important requirements for a great number of work positions. You'll have to solve many problems related to algorithms and data structures at coding interviews. Indeed, you can live without an understanding of algorithms and data structures, in general. However, you can do that until you face a real problem which requires to choose right data structures and implement custom algorithms. If you haven't ever faced such problems, believe me, this is just a matter of time. One day, you'll face such a problem and if you don't understand algorithms and data structures in depth, you'll feel yourself ashamed and helpless. You'll be stuck.If you're not good at algorithms and data structures, you'll never pass a coding interview in a decent company. Almost all the companies prefer to hire those developers who have good understanding of algorithms and data structures, remember that. Do not delay the study of fundamental concepts.Better hardware is not a solution for all the performance-related problems. Sometimes, you need to write software for very slow devices. And that very often depends on the budget of a customer, by the way, so you don't have a control over it.You'd better to understand what's going on under the hood at least one level in-depth. Indeed, if you don't understand how List works, sometimes you'll make sub-optimal or completely wrong decisions.Why this course?You may ask me ""why should I take exactly your course?"" And here is my answer:This course is a comprehensive tutorial which covers a great number of topicsI tried to do my best to make this course not dryThis course concentrates not only at algorithms and data structures in general but it uncovers the internals of data structures and algorithms built-in .NET BCL (.NET Core's BCL is the same regarding fundamental data structures and algorithms)This course is practical with exercises and solutionsThis course will definitely help you to pass technical interviewsThis course is made by a professional software developer with more than 10 years of real-world experienceand many other reasons :)What's in the Course?For now, the course covers:Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures: what is a data structure, abstract data type and what's the difference between these notions. What is an algorithm and why they are important to us?Introduction to Algorithm Analysis: determine how long will a program work, build a log-log plot, approximations, order of growth (Big-O notation), memory consumptionArrays: arrays in C#, arrays in memory, time complexity of operations on arraysSort Algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, recursion, shell sort, merge sort, quick sort, stability of sort algorithmsLists: List built-in .NETBCL, nodes, linked list including singly and doubly linked lists, linked list built-in .NETStacks: theory and practice; stack based on array, stack based on a linked list, stack built-in .NETQueues: theory and practice; queue based on array, circular queue, queue based on linked list, queue built-in .NET BCLSearch Algorithms: linear search, binary search (more will be added in the future)Symbol Tables: intro, API, sequential search-based, binary search-basedHash Tables: intro, hash functions, GetHashCode, approaches to collisions resolving: separate chaining and linear probing, Dictionary built-in BCL, Sets in BCLTrees: binary search tree (BST), implementing BST (more will be added in the future)Heaps: intro, heaps and arrays, implementation, Heap Sort (more will be added in the future, specifically about Priority Queues)Immutable Collections: immutability and memory pressure, immutable stacks and queues, immutable list, immutable sets, immutable dictionaries, builders in immutable collectionsDifferent Algorithms.

E através desses operadores nós manipularemos os dados para conseguir os resultados desejados.Alguns outros conceitos importantes que também aprenderemos neste curso:Os conceitos de linguagem fraca e fortemente tipada, que é a definição da mutabilidade dos tipos dos dados;Estruturas de controle de fluxo de código, que aplicam as restrições condicionais, ou seja, executam partes do código se certas condições forem cumpridas (if/else);Estruturas de repetição, que são aquelas que dadas as condições, repetem o mesmo trecho de código por determinadas vezes (while/for);E também o fluxo de código, que em cima disso, aprenderemos a corrigir os erros ou bugs que possam aparecer.Desbravaremos o mundo das funções que são blocos de código nomeados e que a partir desse nome podem ser chamados em qualquer lugar do algoritmo. As funções representam ferramentas poderosíssimas para transformar dados. Estudaremos vários tipos de funções partindo de suas anatomias e atingindo todas suas possibilidades e funcionalidades.Vale ressaltar que nosso curso está repleto de exercícios e desafios para a fixação do conhecimento.

Um exemplo clássico é a resolução do problema de choque de horários de professores em uma escola, no qual existem diversas combinações de horários e aulas e o objetivo é construir a grade de horário dinamicamente de acordo com a quantidade de aulas e a disponibilidade de cada professor. Outros exemplos são: empresas de telecomunicações podem projetar novas redes óticas, transportadoras podem planejar melhor a rota de entrega de mercadorias, investidores podem escolher os melhores investimentos; dentre várias outras.

Baseado nisso, neste curso você vai aprender na teoria e principalmente na prática como desenvolver do zero um algoritmo genético aplicado em um cenário real de uma transportadora. Neste contexto, nós seremos consultores de uma empresa de transporte que possui vários produtos a serem transportados, porém, a empresa possui somente um caminhão disponível e com espaço limitado de armazenamento. Nosso objetivo será desenvolver um algoritmo que consiga gerar a melhor combinação dos produtos que devem ser transportados, levando em consideração o fato de que a transportadora quer ganhar o máximo de dinheiro possível com o frete e ocupando o espaço disponível no caminhão.

Esse tipo de algoritmo é baseado em encontrar soluções cada vez melhores a partir da evolução das gerações anteriores, sendo fundamentado nos processos naturais de evolução. E para chegar em nosso objetivo, você vai aprender os principais conceitos sobre essa técnica de inteligência artificial, tais como: população, indivíduo, crossover/reprodução e mutação. Ao final do curso, você terá um algoritmo genético completo que conseguirá resolver o problema da transportadora, o qual pode ser aplicado para outros cenários comerciais. Utilizaremos a linguagem R para a programação das funções e desenvolveremos tudo passo a passo e com muitos detalhes, para que você tenha uma visão bem clara e didática de como esses algoritmos conseguem resolver problemas reais do cotidiano. Além disso, teremos um bônus no qual você vai aprender como criar uma tabela de produtos no MySql e aplicar nosso algoritmo utilizando os dados de uma base de dados, o que pode facilitar a adaptação do código para utilização em ambientes comerciais. Por fim, este material pode ser considerado de nível iniciante para quem está entrando tanto na área de Inteligência Artificial quanto na área de algoritmos genéticos. Porém, caso você seja de nível mais avançado, este curso poderá servir como uma ótima fonte de consulta e revisão dos conceitos.

Neste curso você terá uma visão teórica e prática sobre essa área, aplicando todos os conceitos em um projeto prático que terá como objetivo aplicar os algoritmos para encontrar a menor rota entre duas cidades. Utilizaremos duas abordagens: a busca sem informação e a busca com informação. A primeira não apresenta inteligência e é composta pelos algoritmos de busca em largura e profundidade, enquanto que a segunda abordagem será implementada por meio dos algoritmos de busca gulosa e busca A* (A Estrela). Esse último algoritmo é muito utilizado em jogos e foi ele que deu origem à tecnologia de GPS (Global Position System) que muito utilizamos em nosso dia a dia!

704,82778,All about NodeJS,"About this Course



NodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript. But wait ! Isn't Javascript meant to be used for forms and stuff on web pages ?  





  	                          Well that was 10 years ago. The world has gone from 'Oops! You've not filled up the form properly !' days to today's modern web apps and social media sites that rely heavily on Javascript. Google Apps, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn, being handful examples of this movement. And to think that this quantum leap would not have been possible without Javascript is not an overstatement. Today, when you socialize with your friends on Facebook, or use your Gmail inbox, you're running thousands of lines of code written in Javascript, in your browser.  





  	                          With Node JS, you can take this knowledge back on the server, where usually you would expect to see the likes of PHP, Ruby, ASP dot NET etc. But that's only a small portion of the reason why NodeJS is so cool. The fact that you can write full blown networked applications (think chat servers, collaborative tools, real-time data visualisation apps) with just a few lines of code is more than reason enough to not only look at NodeJS, but deep dive into it !  





  	                          But I know PHP ? Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :  





  	Node allows you to write highly scalable networked apps deployed on the cloud !  	You're working at a different level of application design per se with Node and that means that you're not writing an app that sits on top of a stack, you design the stack from the server up. And while that may sound daunting, it really is not and you'll see why.  	You code in the same language, both on the server and on the front end ! We're all polyglots (we use multiple programming languages and syntax in most of our projects), but managing code in the same language on the back-end and the front-end never hurts and in-fact can be a huge time saver when debugging.  	NodeJS is used by the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo and Microsoft to name a few. Its pretty new and consequently you gain advantage from the exponentially growing community of NodeJS  Javascript developers and that's great fun, really !  	If you've been coding in Javascript, you can leverage your existing knowledge and skills and take it to a whole new level !  











  	            The Real Problem





So, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you're here.





  	                      In this course, we'll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !  





  	            Project Oriented Learning    





  	                          With NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.  





  	            A. ChatCAT - One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !  





  	                      You will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development  production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying  Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku  Digital Ocean's Cloud Services and lots more...  





  	      B. PhotoGRID - The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.  





  	                      You will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS  AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing  Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying  Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon's Elastic IP Service  Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...  





  	                          In the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.  





  	                      And I'm always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.





  	      BONUS :: Here's the best thing about this course. The curriculum that you see gets you up and running with NodeJS  Cloud Deployment. However, there is so much more that you can do with NodeJS, which is why I will keep adding new lectures and sections to this course on an ongoing basis. There is so much more that you will get with full lifetime access to lectures and all updates !!
