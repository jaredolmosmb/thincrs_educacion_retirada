Es difícil de creer a primera vista, pero son nuestros miedos, limitaciones y creencias limitantes respecto a nosotros mismos y al mundo que nos rodean que nos impiden realizar las actividades que sabemos que tenemos que hacer para obtener los resultados que queremos alcanzar.En este curso, nos enfocaremos justamente en reconocer en primera instancia, que es realmente la procrastinación, de tal manera que logremos identificar cuáles son los factores personales que nos están llevando a procrastinar y a dejar de lado lo que consideramos importante para nuestra vida.Teniendo esto claro, nos enfocaremos en crear hábitos que nos permita culminar nuestras tareas más fácilmente y ser más productivos en cada una de las áreas de nuestra vida en las cuales nos hemos fijado una meta concreta.Este curso ha sido creado de un procrastinador para los procrastinadores, de tal manera que no se convierta en un curso que repite libros de texto y de autoayuda, que ofrecen técnicas exprés que a largo plazo no tienen utilidad.Este curso es para aquellas personas comprometidas en crear un cambio contundente y radical en su vida, eliminando aquellos hábitos que no les permiten avanzar en su vida y crear aquellos que los lleven mucho más lejos de las metas que se han propuesto.Si estás dispuesto a trabajar en ti, ¡Bienvenido al curso!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/destruye-la-procrastinacion/,366,Secundaria Desarrollo Personal Personal Growth,69,64,David Bejarano,"Tener dificultades para comenzar ciertas actividades, tareas, procesos o metas.

Are your interviews failing to produce enough reliable information to pick consistent ‘winners’? Are you missing out on the best candidates, often losing them to the competition?Whether you’re a seasoned HR professional or an entry-level recruiter, job market insider and hiring strategist Ryan Lecour shares his refreshing blueprint to guide you through the interviewing and hiring process with a step-by-step method that secures the best fit every time.The interview is the only window you have for observing candidates. Business-building and team-transforming decisions are based on these limited and precious hours. Many take credit for the quote ‘a company is only as good as its people'. Truer words cannot be said. And the interview is ground zero for determining how good your company is going to be.In this course, Ryan teaches invaluable foundations on interview planning  execution. Students will learn essential strategies for question building, test administration and candidate evaluation. They’ll also learn key tactics for achieving clarity and verification with candidate profiles, personalities and work history. The course upholds a constant respect for the crucial role the interview plays in determining the fate of companies in areas of team-building and employee selection.Learn to hire consistent winners with proven interview techniques from a leading recruiting strategistThe following are some of the key things you will learn how to do in this course:Cut to the heart of the truth with penetrating sequences of probing questions that reveal critical details surrounding the candidate’s career change historyIdentify the elements of strong and weak candidate questions and learn to evaluate how they contribute to the overall strength of the candidacyBring awareness to unconscious biases that tend to creep into the process and mitigate or eliminate their effect while restoring objectivity and sound evaluationLead the stakeholder synchronization meeting with an organized method that efficiently captures the various dimensions of the position and sets the table for the interview planEstablish preemptive compensation discussions early in the interview process and setup foundations for favorable offer negotiationsBuild an interview kit that guides the interview and ensures the best use of time for all personnel involved in the processRyan draws on nearly a decade of experience witnessing how the interview has the power and influence to ‘make or break’ companies. From supplying key personnel to the offices of Apple, Google and many other Fortune 100 companies, to starting and operating his own successful HR firm, Ryan has learned that decisions on matters of hiring are difficult and almost always based on incomplete information.

In version 6 of the course, you have access to a brand new series of animations that make full use of Udemy's new assignments feature and a new section on designing a longer-term career plan.Udemy's Assignments enable you to receive guided instructions, use your skills, and then see how your instructor does something. We've leveraged this feature by taking the most challenging parts of the Career Hacking™ course and making them easier for you through the use of these guided assignments. For example, when you reach the point in the course where you need to develop bulletpoints for your resume / CV, you'll find an animated Assignment that takes you through the process step-by-step, gives you a chance to develop your own resume bulletpoint using what you've learned in the course, and then shows you how it's done by your instructor.Many of you have also asked for help developing a mid and long-term career plan. In version 6, we've added an additional section to help you. First, you'll learn soft skills that will help you transition to working with a new team and/or at a new job. Then you will have the opportunity to use the VISTA career planning tool that we've built for you so that you can align your values, interests, skills, and more with your career goals.One of the new videos that we've added for you is an interview with Stephen Szermer, someone who successfully completed a big mid-life career change. His story will help anyone who is in a career rut, needs to change careers, or feels like the world has evolved past their existing skill set. We hope you enjoy Career Hacking™ version 6!January 7th, 2019: What's new in version 6.1?We've migrated some of the guides and course tools to Google Drive so that they're usable across all of your devices and easier to use than .pdfs!April 9th, 2019: What's new in version 6.2?You all are amazing! We want to harness the collective power of the Career Hacking™ community to make the course better for you and other future students, so we've added the ability for you to contribute your ideas related to new content and course features through a simple, anonymous feedback mechanism. Thanks for working with us to make your learning experience awesome!June 21st, 2019:What's new in version 6.3? We've just made a HUGEupgrade to your course. Specifically, we:Remastered all videos in the course. We realize that, over the years, we exported videos with varying volume levels. This was causing some of you to have to frequently adjust the volume settings on your playback devices, so Davis spent time remastering the volume across the entire Career Hacking™ learning experience. We've heard many of you ask for additional support with mid and later-life career changes, so Davis spent quite a lot of time creating a comprehensive presentation specifically tailored to the needs of people going through a mid or later-life career change. You can find this presentation in the text lecture where all of the course resources are listed and in a special optional lecture in the career strategy section of the course.The LinkedIn® PowerGame is now a fundamental part of your learning experience.Previously, it was an optional video. We did this because being able to engage in professional networking on LinkedIn® is increasingly important for many careers.Davis migrated two videos that were previously presented in-stream in the course to optional videos. The first video that has been converted to optional viewing is one on tips for people going into a coding interview and the second is for CareerHackers looking to get a USVisa. Because these are specialized scenarios, we want to make sure that they're taken by those who need them, not everyone who participates in Career Hacking™. November 1, 2019:What's new in version 6.4?You've asked and we've delivered!Career Hacking™ is now fully closed captioned in English so that you can clearly understand key CareerHacking™ concepts and so that students whose first language isn't English can have a fuller learning experience and develop their English skills while taking the course!We're introducing a suite of Voices from the Field lectures.This lecture style is something that Davis learned while participating in Harvard's Leaders of Learning program. In each lecture, we pose an important career management question to experts with a variety of professional expertise and backgrounds so that you can get multiple informed viewpoints on these topics. In this update, we feature experts with experience in technical recruiting, in placing candidates looking for work after receiving professional certificates, in helping MBAgraduates get jobs, in coaching executives in Silicon Valley, and in breaking into the financial services sector. Thanks for joining us in the Career Hacking™ course!January 4, 2020:What's new in version 6.5?When you're searching for a job, keeping records of your applications and managing your professional network are super important. Previously, we showed you how to take care of these problems using Podio® as your ""Job Search CRM"" platform. However, Podio® is really designed to be used by teams for much more complex activities, so Davis Jones, this course's designer, built a custom tool for Career Hacking™ participants that's built on top of Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. It's called the Career Hacking™ Hub. This free software keeps all of your information private (essentially, it's a modified Google Sheet that you own), and it pairs perfectly with what you learn in your Career Hacking™ learning experience. You should find this tool convenient, free, and helpful. You can learn more about it inside the course. We're always trying to add value for you and to support your success!Welcome to Career Hacking™ 6.5.January 14, 2020: What's new in version 6.5.1?Your fellow Career Hacker David Williamson contributed a valuable new career hack related to uncovering small and medium-sized businesses who don't often advertise higher-level positions publicly. It's been added in the description of the ""Hidden Job Market""module. Thanks David!March 13th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.2?You'll find a new SideBySide that walks you through using the new Career Hacking™ Hub App. This should enable you to get up and running with the newest technology feature of the Career Hacking™ course quickly!April 20th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.3?We've started responding to the Coronavirus pandemic by adding additional resources to yourCareer Hacking™ experience.July 30th, 2020:What's new in version 6.5.4?After auditing CareerHacking™, we found that some of the course's resources were difficult for mobile users to access. So, we've upgraded the way we saved and uploaded your Career Hacking™ resources, and also added multiple cloud-based (Google Drive)resources.This should make it easier for you to take your CareerHacking™ on mobile devices, and in situations when your access to broadband may be limited.November 2020:What's new in version 6.6?Wow. There are a BUNCHof new updates to your Career Hacking™ course!You have a completely rebuilt resume-writing section. Specifically, your course has transitioned to building your resume in Google Docs by default. This has a number of benefits for you:Your resume is now mobile-friendly. This is increasingly important, because your career conversations are now taking place, in the earliest stages at least, via messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp®, LinkedIn® messenger, Twitter®, DMs, etc.). In those situations, the person on the other end of your message is most likely on a mobile device. Now, when you send them your resume, it will open to a perfectly-formatted, mobile-friendly version.ALL of the Career Hackers in this course will now be able to create best-in-class resumes using the templates provided--whether you have access to Microsoft Word® (a paid software program) or not. Transitioning to Google Docs® makes your Career Hacking™ course more diverse and inclusive for our global Career Hacking™ community.You'll now be able to short link to your resume. This will make it easier for you to share your resume, and you'll look like the tech-savvy person you are when you do it.You'll still be able to export your resume to traditional formats (like PDF and .doc).Important note: You can ABSOLUTELY still use Microsoft Word to build your resume. The course fully supports Microsoft Word®, Pages (Mac), and other word processing softwares.You have a completely rebuilt LinkedIn® section. In recent years, LinkedIn® has made a number of important updates to the layout of the platform, how features are arranged, and how media is presented. So, your new Career Hacking™ course has brand new, fresh tutorials to enable you to take advantage of the Platform's most important tools and features.New content on pre-interviewing and digital messaging. According to our network of labor market experts, an increasing number of career relationships are starting with informal message swaps. For example, you may connect with a recruiter on LinkedIn® and then immediately exchange a few career-related messages with them. Your new Career Hacking™ course embraces this new reality, and equips you with the tools to succeed in these message exchanges. This part of the recruiting process, which we call ""pre-interviewing"", is now covered in the Course.Increased support for remote workers and applying for remote opportunities. An increasing number of roles are remote or partially remote, and these opportunities appeal to many Career Hackers. So, we've integrated a number of changes to your resume-writing, networking, and LinkedIn® profile design approaches that enable you to increase your ability to succeed in the distributed work environment.We've added new Voices from the Field and interview lectures.We've updated your LinkedIn® and resume writing guides, with brand new content that aligns with changes to the respective platforms, approaches, and wording practices involved in creating a stand-out professional profile. Enjoy the updates!November 2020:What's new in version 6.6.1?Your course has a bunch of fresh new links.

Specifically, we've added a new ""Voices from the Field"" lecture where you'll meet a wide variety of professionals who share how they'd like to be approached on LinkedIn® for new networking opportunities. We've also invested in new content for you around the legality of using images sourced from previous employers or partners on your LinkedIn® profile--an area of content for which we have received a number of requests.We've added additional resources for those of you looking to transition into technology roles.We've upgraded many of your tools around using LinkedIn® for networking and for ""pre-interviewing"", because we're seeing an increasing amount of job search activity happening on LinkedIn®.Enjoy the updates!!January 2022:What's new in version 6.7.1?In this update, we've added professionally-developed English-language subtitles to all of the new lectures that were published in the recent upgrade.

You’ve got all the strategies you need in this growth hacking course.   In the first part of the course, you’ll gain essential “big picture” skills, including developing your customer personas, interviewing your target markets, and analyzing your “buyer center” (i.e. the individuals in your target market with the most purchasing power).   Next, you’ll learn how to analyze your results. With any growth hacking effort, you always want to know what’s working, where it’s working, and what needs to be changed. For this, you need digital marketing tools like web traffic analysis and lean analytics.  Lastly, you’ll discover highly effective tools to bring boatloads of new customers – ones with money to spend – into your online eco-system. This includes the concepts of digital conversion funnels, lifetime customer value (LTV), and customer acquisition costs (CAC). 

 Develop a User-Centric Approach to Digital Marketing You’ll start by learning what growth hacking is and then move on to building your digital analytics skills.We'll take your Google Analytics skills to the next level by teaching you how to use these advanced tools with real data from the Google Merchandise Store. Then, you'll learn how to develop marketing personas and user segments--using online research methods (like Facebook Audience Insights) and the person-to-person interviewing methods used by companies like IDEOand Apple in Silicon Valley. Then, you'll learn how to work with Pirate Metrics and marketing funnels so that you can guide potential customers through each step... from awareness to revenue to referrals.In the second half of the course, you’ll discover how to create digital marketing materials that target the unique wants and needs of your customer. This might seem like a given, right? In fact, it’s a much rarer skill than you might think, and absolutely crucial for maximizing sales. No growth hacking course is complete without this must-know info! Then you’ll get a crash course in both online SEO and in content marketing, allowing you create relevant and memorable content that’s designed to be discoverable on the web. The email marketing section will introduce you to automated strategies for email. You’ll also develop the ability to use email platforms to manage your subscriber lists.In the later parts of the course, you'll learn how to estimate and use both LifetimeCustomerValue (LTV)and Customer AcquisitionCosts (CAC)--two critical metrics for building a digital marketing engine. The course wraps up with a section on paid acquisition(like PPC Ads andsocial media ads) so that you can bring traffic into the ""top of your funnel"" on-demand.Also, this is version 7 of this course!

PRACTICAL TRAINING WITH REAL SPATIAL DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















DEVELOP MAD GIS SKILLS AND PERFORM SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS USING FREE KICKASS TOOLS SUCH AS QGIS, R, GRASS AND GOOGLE EARTH. 

















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

















This course is designed to take users who use R and QGIS for basic spatial data/GIS analysis to perform more advanced GIS tasks (including automated workflows and geo-referencing) using a variety of different data. In addition to making you proficient in R and QGIS for spatial data analysis, you will be introduced to another powerful free GIS software.. GRASS.

















This course takes a completely practical approach to spatial data analysis and mapping- Each lecture will teach you a practical application/processing technique which you can apply easily.

















The course is taught by Minerva Singh, A PhD graduate from Cambridge University, UK, who has several years of research experience in Quantitative Ecology and an MPhil in Geography and Environment from Oxford University. Minerva has published papers in international peer reviewed journals and given talks at international conferences.  

















The underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can put spatial data analysis into practice today and develop sound GIS analysis skills. You’ll be able to start analyzing spatial data for your own projects, and IMPRESS YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYERS with examples of your PRACTICAL spatial data analysis abilities. This course is different from other training resources. Each lecture seeks to enhance your GIS skills in a demonstrable and tangible manner and provide you with practically implementable GIS solutions.

















This is an intermediate course in spatial data analysis, i.e. we will build on on basic spatial data analysis tasks (such as those covered in the beginner version course: Core Spatial Data Analysis: Introductory GIS with R and QGIS) and teach users how to practically implement more complex GIS tasks such as interpolation, mapping spatial data, geo-referencing and detailed vector processing. Additionally you will be introduced to preliminary geo-statistics and mapping/visualizing spatial data. 

















This course covers complex GIS techniques, and by completing this course, you will be implementing these PRACTICALLY in freely-available software, thus making you MORE ATTRACTIVE TO EMPLOYERS.  

















It is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend a tiny amount of time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts pertaining to the different spatial data analysis techniques demonstrated in the course. However, majority of the course will focus on working with real spatial data from different sources. After each video you will learn how to practically implement a new concept or technique in the different softwares used for the course.

















During the course of my research I have discovered that R is a powerful tool for collating and analyzing spatial data acquired from different sources.  Proficiency in spatial data analysis in R and QGIS has helped me publish more peer reviewed papers faster. Feel free to check out my profile on ResearchGate.

















FREE BONUS: You will have access to all the data used in the course, along with the R code files. You will also have access to future lectures, resources and R code files. Enroll in the course today  take advantage of this special bonus!

















I don’t have to remind you that we have a RISK-FREE GUARANTEE in the case of you not being satisfied with the course. Take action now!

87,3491366,*NEW* Advanced Forms - 2022 Build & Master Web forms,"THENITTYGRITTYOFWEBFORMS?A web form is also known as an HTML form. It’s a place where users can enter data that’s then sent to a server for processing. Web forms allow users to place orders on your site, to provide their name and email address to sign up for a newsletter, or to sign up as a member to your site and so forth.What’s really great about web forms is that there is no “one size fits all”. You can use your artistic flare, and personal business acumen to create web forms with a particular length, format, content type and appearance.By doing this course, you’ll be able to improve your web form usability, which will ultimately enhance user experience and get website visitors excited about completing your form and converting.Why is this course so important?Forms which are on point present an opportunity for a company to grow and capture loyalty.A form can often be both a marketing tool and a necessity. A form that puts the user at ease, that evokes feelings of trust, will get filled out far more often than a form which looks (or is) complicated and confusing. After completing my “Advanced Forms” course, you will be knowledgeable, confident and the “go-to” person for forms.Let me share my form building skills with youUnderstanding how forms work will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master forms and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering a perfect, interactive and functional form is challenging. In this course, I take a deep-dive into explaining web forms and how they work. Why do we need to wrap our form within form tags? How can you include a progress bar in a form? How can you customize a toggle or checkbox? Where does the data go once a user clicks on the submit button? How can you perform validation on your form? How can a user upload a file? What happens once the data arrives at the server? What are the different types of events we can listen to on forms? By understanding these questions, and many more in the course, you will be able to build advanced forms and better yet, understand the full stack process! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic forms that improve user engagement and experience.WHATTHISCOURSECOVERSThis course is huge and comprehensive, from basics to advancedThis course will give you solid fundamentals and practicals regarding forms. It can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from this course with an advanced understanding and practical experience with building forms. It will take you to the point where you will understand what method (GET or POST) to use when sending form data, how to define where the data goes, how to perform advanced client-side validation (checking errors on the form before it is sent to the server), how to write custom pattern validation rules (using regular expressions), how to run servers and how to view all HTTP request information. This is awesome knowledge. This course will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end form web development.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” FORMS by gaining an understanding of how you can build it, manipulate it and style it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Why should you learn so much about forms?A web form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a relationship with them. The time you spend in bringing the user to your website should be matched with the time spent in perfecting the user experience with your web forms. It is surprising to see so many sites these days contain complex and frustrating web forms that cause a negative experience.Ultimately, a web form allows your visitors to get in contact with you and to send information, such as an order, a catalogue request, or even a query, which is passed on to your database.Can you begin to see how important forms are and how their use can be escalated?*** A comprehensive FORMScourse on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how HTML code works behind the scenes. This is particularly true when it comes to building forms. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know, really know, how forms work. You need to understand how the browser URL encodes form data, how the browser sends data to a URL that you specify, and how to perform validation to ensure the user does not submit invalid data.A unique approachYou will learn ""why"" things work and not just ""how"". Understanding advanced topics about forms (lURL encoding, accept-charset, multipart/form-data, regex, etc) is important as it will give you infinite possibilities and upskill you. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create forms that are tailored to your needs, and allow the form data to get submitted to a server via AJAX. You will be able to create forms that are customizable by the user (for example, if the user wants to change the color of the form theme). You can create a control on a form that displays the progress completion of the form and displays messages to the user along the way.Can you begin to see how pivotal forms are and how important having knowledge about forms is?How is this course different?There are lots of courses that focus on web development. Many never get into the detail about how HTML forms work behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master in order to utilize potential.In this course, I focus on the more advanced topics of true web development when it comes to forms. This includes understanding what all of the attributes on the form element mean, understanding the different input types in detail, what URL encoding is, and how data is sent over the wire to a server.Practice makes perfectTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.I love practical examples, which is why we build multiple forms in this course, starting in section 1.Is this course for you?Absolutely. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:Student #1: You want to advance in the world of programming.Student #2: You want to know how successful developers build dynamic forms that engage with the user, have high conversions that put them ahead of the competition.Student #3: You want to gain a solid understanding of how forms really workStudent #4: You want to start using backend technologies like Node or PHP with formsWHY START NOW?Right this second, your competitors are learning how to become better web developers.Web development is a blazing hot topic at the moment, and in the foreseeable future. But you have a distinct advantage. This course offers memorable learning topics, actionable tactics and real-world examples.Lets get started!What do you get?Lifetime access to all tutorial videos. No fees or monthly subscriptions.QA support.Quizzes, coding challenges, a test and assignments to help you learn.I’ve allowed you to download all of my lectures for offline viewing.Let's get excited about becoming a professional web developer, and to be able to confidently apply it to your own websites.See you in the lectures.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/master-web-forms/,1301,Web Development,245,217,Clyde Matthew,"A desire to become an informed full stack web developer

88,2696476,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 1,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youUnderstanding the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. How exactly does the browser model your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Where can we access this model? What can we do with this model? How can we change this model? By understanding these questions, you will be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 1 of 2This course is the first course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do Course 2) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 1 with a basic understanding and practical experience. It will take you to the point where you will understand what the DOM is, why we need it, how to access it, where to find it and how to manipulate it. This is awesome knowledge. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development.In this course you’ll learn about front-end Web Development, by mastering the Document Object Model.Why do you need to know about the DOM?So, you know some HTML, you’ve created your first tags, learned about CSS, made awesome forms, star-gazing buttons, responsive pages and have started to create dynamic and interesting pages.But now you want to do more: “How can I add animation (and life) to my page? I wish I could give an error message to a user who incorrectly submits a form!”And this is where the DOM comes into the picture. and where this course(s) provide you with an opportunity to grow in your skills.To cut a long story short, we use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.The first step in understanding the DOM is understanding what it is. How does it differ from your HTML markup? How does it differ from JavaScript? From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to access the DOM. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to access and traverse the DOM. We don’t stop here, but then get into more advanced things like manipulating the DOM (via the create and remove methods given to us by the DOM API).Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” DOM by gaining an understanding of where you can find it, how you can access it, and more importantly, how you can manipulate it. We dig deeper in every lecture, learning about things like Nodes, the difference between HTTPCollections vs NodeLists, and a whole bunch more! This course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new remove API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** A must-do Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how your browser represents your HTML code and works behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to deal with the DOM. You need to know how to access it, how to manipulate it, and how to dynamically interact with it.I want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.I want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.This course is perfect for you.DescriptionHi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to learn how successful web developers can create whizbang websites that are dynamic and engaging!The root to understanding how to be a professional front-end web developer is understanding the Document Object Model and applying it to practical situations. We're going to practice and learn and emerge confident to tackle any challenges modern programs and websites throw at us.After completing a few university degrees, and post graduate studies, I developed a fascination for web design and software languages. For several years I have immersed myself in this. I spent a fair bit on top courses and went on to apply the knowledge practically.

89,2733254,*UPDATED* DOM 2022 Build Dynamic Websites JavaScript Part 2,"Let me share my new front-end web development secrets with youMastering the DOM will equip you to become an awesome front-end web programmer. Learn how to implement your creative, different and dynamic ideas into your website. Master front-end development and you’re half way to becoming a full stack web developer. Take control through understanding. Delivering an interactive web experience is challenging. In this advanced course, we take a deep-dive into DOM events. What are they? Why are they important? The different types of events we can listen to? Where do they come from? What is event bubbling and event capturing, and how does it help? By understanding these questions, and more, you'll be able to access the DOM and better yet, manipulate it! In other words, you will be able to create dynamic apps that improve user engagement and experience.What this course covers?This course is Course 2 of 2This course is the second and final course of a 2-part program. The reason I have done this is that Course 1 provides everything you need to start coding dynamic sites by yourself. It gives you the sound fundamentals and practicals regarding the DOM. It can be taken alone (you don’t have to do both courses) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from Course 2 with a solid understanding and practical experience of working with events in the DOM. Course 2 provides a whole different world of fun with amazing practical examples that will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and set you well on your way to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development. In this course you’ll learn more about front-end web development, by working with events in the Document Object Model.Why this course?Why do you need to know about events in the DOM?If you've ever wondered how you can add animation (and life) to a page, then you need to understand how events work in the DOM. We use the DOM to allow users to interact with our app. It doesn’t have to be annoying interaction either – simple things like giving the user the ability to ADD/EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE contents on your page, for example, requires interaction with the DOM.This course starts off with understanding what an event is. What are the 2 most important things when it comes to events? What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler? From there, you’ll start exploring the different ways you can add events to your code. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to ‘listen’ for events on your web page and then interact with the page when those events happen. We don’t stop here, but get into more advanced things like learning about how an event travels in the DOM (capturing vs bubbling), which leads us to an even more important topic of ... wait for it ... event delegation. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We go into many other things like DOM extensions, object hierarchy and a bunch of other stuff.Knowledge of the DOM is incredibly useful for understanding how your webpage can be improved.By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” DOM by gaining an understanding of how you can manipulate it in meaningful and practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills.Through practical examples, this course helps you understand the DOM piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers (like the new classList API) along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.*** An advanced Web Development course on Udemy ***Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code.

Take control through understanding. Delivering a fast web experience requires a lot of work by the browser. Most of this work is hidden from web developers: we write the markup, and a nice looking page comes out on the screen. But how exactly does the browser go from consuming our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rendered pixels on the screen? By understanding this, you will be able to write better code in order to boost your website traffic, know how to precision fix and tweak behaviour and performance, improve your market penetration and your margins. You’ll also gain an advantages over other developers who seem to just push the buttons without fully appreciating what is happening.What this course covers?In this course you’ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path. This refers to the set of steps browsers must take to fetch and then convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living, breathing websites. From there, you’ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to measure performance. You’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to deliver the first pixels to the screen as early as possible.Knowledge of the CRP is incredibly useful for understanding how a site's performance can be improved.

Change all of that by enrolling in ""Sourdough Bread Baking 101.""This is the sourdough baking course you need if you are just starting out in sourdough bread baking. In my other courses, I teach how to bake all sorts of sourdough breads, but in this course, I won't load you down with lots of information, just enough so it is easy and fun to bake your first loaf of sourdough. You will first learn how to make your own sourdough starter at home, day by day with detailed instructions, videos and a free pdf downloadable booklet. Next, you'll move onto baking waffles to test your new sourdough starter and then onto your first sourdough test loaf. Once you've taken a basic white sourdough loaf, steaming hot, out of your own oven, you will be ready to move on to more complex formulas. There are two basic sourdough bread formulas in this course. I call them ""First Loaf"" and ""Second Loaf."" We will follow the easy step by step directions of the process together. The first loaf is easy. It is a one day round boule with a lower hydration dough, which means it is not too wet or sticky. The second loaf is a two day high hydration dough and is a batard or French style loaf. Working together, I will show you how to handle a wet, sticky dough and how to do an autolyse. This bread results in a lovely tasting bread with large holes and a wonderful crispy crust. This course is for BEGINNERS who have no idea of how to bake with sourdough or those who have tried and stumbled. I have fifteen years of experience teaching the newbie sourdough baker, so come on! Let's have some fun! You know want to!This course would make an excellent gift for the aspiring baker in your family circle, whether an older baker or a young new baker. Some skills you will learn:How to make and care for your own sourdough starterWhy it's important to weigh ingredients. Gathering some basic baking equipmentHow to mix and fold dough. No kneading here.Shaping, scoring and baking the dough.What to do after you've baked your first loaf... hint (bake your second loaf!)When you have finished Sourdough Bread Baking 101, you will have the confidence to not only bake using your own sourdough starter, you will be ready for more advanced sourdough baking techniques which will enable you to bake all sorts of sourdough artisan breads.

132,430604,12 Strategies for Dealing With Difficult People,"I'm right there with you my friend.  Difficult People Suck!Let me ask a few questions.Are you frustrated with difficult people?Do you find difficult people to be challenging? Who are some difficult people in your life? Your boss? Coworkers and customers? Your spouse/partner? Your kids?Do you feel trapped?Are you losing sleep? (This is a big healthy lifestyle red flag!)Do you pause for a moment to take a deep breath before you go into work, or a meeting, just to prepare yourself for the onslaught you know you are going to deal with?Have you ever looked at your paycheck to see if you have enough sick time built up so you just don't have to go into work today? How did you feel when you realized you didn't have enough time built up and you had to go it? Even sicker? I get it.Again, I'm right there with you my friend. I have lost entire weekends due to the overwhelming stress caused by that one difficult customer I'm scheduled to meet on Monday morning. So much stress I couldn't leave it behind, even for a few hours, to really enjoy time with my family. Does this sentence sound familiar? “Your here but you are not really here.” I get it.Difficult people SUCK!I have screamed at the top of my lungs, in my car, while back fisting the passenger seat headrest to the point I’ve ripped the skin off my knuckles. I even purchased a new mattress and pillow thinking that it might actually help me sleep through the night. It didn’t work. I still didn’t sleep well and the stress just kept building.I’ve purchased Melatonin (sleep aid) even when it wasn’t on a Buy One Get One sale. I can also find the bottle of Tylenol PM in complete darkness at 02:00 AM. I've walked away from jobs, that I've loved, due to a boss being so unreasonably difficult I just couldn't put my job in front of my health any longer. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this, but there must be some sort of science that explains why the air instantly seems fresher the moment you choose to walk (or run) away from a toxic situation.Difficult people are just unhealthy.  I’ve skipped meals because I was too stressed to eat which usually resulted in me hitting a drive-through just because “I just need something.” 40+ pounds later…”Well, this isn’t working for me.” I get it.Difficult people have caused me to be physically sick. I've felt physical back pain because I was so stressed out and tense knowing that I was going to be dealing with difficult co-workers tomorrow.Let me ask a couple more questions:What would it feel like to sleep peacefully throughout the night?Wouldn't it be great to have a few key strategies that make dealing with difficult people a lot easier? What would it feel like to have control of the situation?What would it feel like to be able to leave work behind and enjoy your evening, your weekend, or even your vacation?What would it feel like to actually “Look forward to work tomorrow”?What would it feel like to have the power to “Fire” that one difficult customer that takes up so much of your time, your thoughts, and your work?What if dealing with difficult people actually becomes a fun game you become really good at playing?Once I began to master these strategies, the air became fresher, my sleep improved, and I became healthier and happier.

135,949846,3 Minute French - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Bonjour et bienvenue :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute French as a way to make learning French easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the French language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no French at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak French, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn French.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE FRENCH WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of French that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak French comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a French speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep French fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with French and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning French with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work well.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak French you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute French today.Merci :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-full-course-1/,263,Language Learning,106,82,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no French and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute French courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in French. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the French language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in French, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in French so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute French courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the French structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your French vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-french-course-2/,266,Language Learning,93,80,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute French Course 1""

We'll look at some new verbs and learn how they are used differently in French to how they're used in English. We'll also begin to look at a very useful tool for new language learners: directions. Learning how to ask for directions is invaluable, because it will very often be one of the easiest ways for you to start to tune your ear into the French language. I'll give you a few tips on how to do this.The sentences in this course might seem a little longer than the ones we've been used to, so far, but this is a great way for you to get your tongue around the French pronunciation.

146,943496,3 Minute German - Course 1 | Language lessons for beginners,"Hallo und wilkommen :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute German as a way to make learning German easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the German language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no German at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak German, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn German.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE GERMAN WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of German that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak German comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a German speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep German fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with German and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning German with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak German you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute German today.Danke :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-german-full-course-1/,283,Language Learning,100,89,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no German and nothing about languages

157,979222,3 Minute Portuguese - Course 1 | Lessons for beginners,"Olá e bem-vindo :-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I’ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn’t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute Portuguese as a way to make learning Portuguese easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the Portuguese language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no Portuguese at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you’ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak Portuguese, so I’ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn Portuguese.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE PORTUGUESE WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of Portuguese that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don’t have to worry about trying to remember everything; you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak Portuguese comfortably and with confidence whenever you’re in a Portuguese speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won’t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you’ll keep Portuguese fresh and exciting and you’ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you’ll get bored with Portuguese and it’ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt’s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it’ll quickly become a habit that you’ll do without thinking. It’s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you’ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you’ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It’ll think, “I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don’t see it for very long, so I’d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!” You’ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that’s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can’t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Portuguese with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Portuguese you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Portuguese today.Obrigado :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-portuguese-full-course-1/,220,Language Learning,75,66,Kieran Ball,"The good thing about this course is that it is taught under the assumption that you know no Portuguese and nothing about languages

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute Spanish courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in Spanish. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the Spanish language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar; everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in Spanish, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in Spanish so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute Spanish courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the Spanish structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your Spanish vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3-minute-spanish-course-2/,288,Language Learning,103,90,Kieran Ball,"Before taking this course, make sure you are confident with all the words and phrases you learnt in ""3 Minute Spanish Course 1""

I'll show you how to create compelling models, how to use Blender's logic bricks to write basic games with no programming, and we'll finally transition to writing your own code with the powerful and popular Python language built into Blender.  I've had a blast creating this course.  I can't wait to share it with you.  The best part of making a game is storing your own playfulness inside a game.  I see this course in exactly the same way.  Let's play together and build some awesome games.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/3d-game-development-with-blender/,671,Game Development,40,40,Andy Harris,"Please download and install a recent version of Blender (2.76 or greater.)

183,1095384,"3ds Max + AE: Learn VFX, Camera Tracking and Compositing","There are few better ways to present a project to your clients than through aerial fly-overs of a proposed building.  Drones have made it easier than ever to aerial footage of your projects sites.  In this course you will learn to take drone footage (or really any kind of footage), whether it is shot by you or someone else, and composite in your 3D creations easily and convincingly. 3DS Max and After Effects already have all the built-in tools that you need for creating visual effects using 3D composited into live footage.  Follow this course and you will be amazed at how quickly and easily you can be up to speed, creating your own movie-like effects, using software you probably already have access to.

This course is broken down into three main sections:





Inside of After Effects -- This is where I will show you how to generate and export 3D camera tracking data for later use in 3DS Max.Inside 3DS Max -- From AE, we will get a camera the exactly matches the zoom angle and movement of our live video footage, but in Max we will have to adjust its scale and rotation in order to get it to match with the real world.  Once we have that, we can add any 3D elements we want to the footage.Bring It All Back Together In After Effects -- This is where we will do some compositing. The goal is to make the 3D animation elements and the live footage mesh together seamlessly and convincingly.





This course is hands on.  You will be following along with me creating a basic aerial fly-over.  You will learn the exact workflow that you need, plus a ton of tips and tricks that will help you to not get hung up when you graduate to your own projects.  I have already done all the troubleshooting for you, so learn from my experience. Check out the promo video to learn more about me, and about the project you will creating in the course.

198,2098232,4G LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - Concepts and call flows,"LTE (4G) is the first network technology that is capable of delivering high-speed data to subscribers. It is the most widely deployed 3GPP technology and its adoption has been the fastest compared to its predecessors (2G, 3G). 4G LTE lays the foundation for the future 5G networks. This course is designed to provide students with in-depth information regarding LTE EPC architecture. The course has been designed for all levels and starts off by providing the introduction to LTE and its advantages over legacy technologies. We then quickly start by building the foundation needed to understand the LTE technology and its architecture. During the lectures, all concepts are introduced by means of intuitive diagrams and real-network examples whenever possible.  Here are some of the reasons why this course is different compared to others - 1. Robust structureLTE EPC is a complex and very exhaustive topic. That is why we have organized the lectures in a way that students can quickly understand concepts.2. Intuitive Examples and Use Cases So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory. But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind LTE.3. Real network Examples In this course, we use real Wireshark traces from a test network to describe call flows rather than just relying on theory. This way we are able to deliver practical information to the students that will help them in real-world scenarios.4. 3GPP based material Throughout the course, we refer to the relevant 3GPP specifications so that students can become familiar with 3GPP specifications. 5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT  Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful LTE EPC course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help. No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. Therefore, feel free to send us a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Good Luck and Happy learning!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/4g-lte-evolved-packet-core-deep-dive-and-call-flows/,291,Network & Security,22,21,Suryabh S,"Laptop with Internet connectivity

Join more than 7,000 students learning about interesting research in psychology!



If you've ever wanted an easy way to start learning about psychology, this is the course for you!



In this free course, you'll learn about 5 studies in psychology and see how their results reveal interesting things about human thought and behavior.



The studies in this course reveal…



how we can persuade someone to do what we want without even providing good reasonswhy praising some kids for their intelligence vs. their hard word dramatically changed their test scoreswhy people who held a hot cup of coffee instead of an iced coffee automatically started thinking a stranger was especially generous and caring…and more!



Carefully designed experiments tell us a great deal about the choices we make, the ways we behave, and why we think the way we do. I'm a social psychologist myself, and I thought about which studies most interested me early in my education and which studies are my current favorites. I even reached out to my colleagues to ask them what studies have most inspired them and are important for everyone to know about.



So enroll in this fun introductory course and start seeing how simple research in psychology tells us amazing things about human thought and behavior!

Es un método maravilloso si es que necesitas desarrollar aplicaciones rápidas, sin tanta personalización.ADO.NET - Capa Conectada: Este mecanismo, nos permite ejecutar consultas a la base de datos directamente, con la advertencia de que tendremos que tener una conexión abierta para interactuar con la base de datos.ADO.NET - Capa Desconectada: Con este otro mecanismo, en lugar de tener una conexión abierta en todo momento, llenamos un objeto tipo DataSet, el cual contendrá una copia de la información que especifiquemos, para trabajar con dicha información fuera de línea, es decir, que no tendremos que estar conectados a la base de datos para utilizar la información.Dapper: Un simple, pero efectivo mapeador de objetos para .NET, con el cual, podremos consultar información de una tabla con tan sólo algunas líneas de código.Entity Framework: Un completo ORM (Mapeador de objetos relacionales) lanzado por Microsoft, la cual es una herramienta que simplifica el mapeo entre objetos a las tablas y columnas de una base de datos relacional.Sin duda, esta es una guía excelente, para aquellos que apenas inician con .Net y C#, o bien, para aquellos que ya tienen experiencia desarrollando con alguno de estas técnicas, pero desconoce completamente sobre los demás temas.¿Qué esperas para conectar tu aplicación a tu base de datos SQL Server?",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/conectar-c-sharp-a-sql-server/,463,Programming Languages,61,60,Héctor Uriel Pérez,"Nociones básicas de C#

217,1154438,50 Tools for the Ultimate Accelerated Learning Office,"(Make sure to read about the special 2-for-1 course bonus at the bottom of this description)

This course has a history...







In 2014 I published my second course (I now have over 50 available on Udemy). 







It was called 50 Learning Machines. 







It was my collection of all my favorite software tools for learning faster. 









As a bonus, I included about 15 of my favorite pieces of hardware that I use for learning.









It turned out that this hardware bonus was just as popular, if not more popular, with my students than the software, apps and plugins I recommended in the main body of the course.









Over the years I've added to my collection of hardware tools and developed this idea of building hte ultimate workbench for accelerated learners.









This course is the result of that 3 year mission. 









This time around all 50 machines are hardware tools, and I've even included some bonuses on top of the original 50 that cover some cutting edge technology that I think is worth taking a look at. 









This course has cost me over $10,000 in testing to create. I've tested tons of different items to come up with this final list. I've done lots of research on each category of tool to find the best in the category. I've optimized for price and performance. 









Along with the tools, I also share how I use them, which is just as valuable, if not more so, than the list of tools itself. 









You'll learn many strategies here that I don't teach in my other courses and am revealing here for the first time. 









The first edition of 50 Learning Machines was one of my best selling courses and great reviews. 









BONUS for a limited time:









As a bonus, every student that finishes this course to 100% will get free access to the original 50 learning machines course with all the original software, mobile apps and browser extensions completely free. 









See you on the inside.

Scroll below for the answer...Correct: 1.Correct option:AWS Storage GatewayAWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your existing on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud. Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases. These include moving tape backups to the cloud, reducing on-premises storage with cloud-backed file shares, providing low latency access to data in AWS for on-premises applications, as well as various migration, archiving, processing, and disaster recovery use cases.AWS Storage Gateway service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access.Incorrect options:""AWS Direct Connect"" - AWS Direct Connect creates a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC. This is a private connection and does not use the public internet. Takes at least a month to establish this connection. Direct Connect is a connectivity service and you cannot use it to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""AWS Snowball"" - AWS Snowball is a data transport solution that accelerates moving terabytes to petabytes of data into and out of AWS services using storage devices designed to be secure for physical transport. You cannot use Snowball to provide AWS Cloud based storage access to on-premises applications.""Amazon EBS"" - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

Well, yes!







Why an hour? Because that's all you need as an experienced developer!







We'll see the basics constructs of the language - variables, conditionals, loops, strings and arrays. Being an experienced developer you probably don't need an explanation of ""what a loop is"" but you want to see how loop is done in Kotlin. This is my attitude through all this course - I won't waste your time in telling you things you already know. I'll try to show you new things and give you the direction to go on.







Developers: want a fast introduction to Kotlin? If you're familiar with Java, I can help you get up to speed in just a couple of of hours.







Kotlin is a fascinating new language that's attracted lots of attention, including from Google. In this short course you'll get to know Kotlin and its essentials. You'll be able to start writing code in no time. 









































If you are an experienced developer and heard the buzz about Kotlin - this course is for you.

























If you are a Java developer and want to dive into Kotlin, I'll help you translate your Java knowledge into Kotlin expertise in no time.

























If you are a Java developer and heard all those talking about Kotlin, but you don't know where to start - start here. Your java knowledge will be translated quickly into kotlin.





















In this course I'll show you the essentials of this young and amazing language. We'll work with the IntelliJ IDE but if you just want to taste the language without any downloads or installations - that's fine, I'll introduce the Kotlin Playground which is a great tool for writing and evaluating Kotlin on line without any configurations.





















We'll see how Kotlin's functions work, and how functional programming is done in Kotlin.





















We'll see how OOP is done in Kotlin and what are the main improvements over java.





















Finally, I'll give you some suggestions to what else can be done and which topics you might want to get interested in the Kotlin's ecosystem.





















Hope you choose to take this course and get to know Kotlin, a fascinating new language!

You’re in for a treat.  This is my favorite UX web design project for GIMP users!  You’ll learn something you didn’t know was possible… how to find out what font was used from a (flattened) JPG file!  Yep, I’ll show you where to upload your file and a computer will crunch it’s database of 100,000+ fonts and tell you which one was used!So far, most of our UX web design projects have had a modern, clean UX web design style applied to them.  Not this time.  We’re going all out on transforming a plain, boring site with a bold, fun retro web design style.  Oh, and we are still focusing on an awesome (UX) user experience with the overall web design.You’ll start off by creating a retro slider for the Hero section.  Then you’ll design an e-commerce like body section featuring old-movie posters.  Plus, I've added more pro UX (user experience) web design tips and useful tips for using GIMP!GIMP Web Design Project 7By now, you’ve learned just about all my UX web design tips.  Don’t despair.  I have a few more pro tips and GIMP tricks to share with you in this final UX web design project.Including, how to transform an ordinary, boring, plain, photo into a work-of-art; a Watercolor (in GIMP).  No worries.  No need to buy a canvas, brushes or watercolor paint.  I’ll show you how to do it all in GIMP!Once you’ve completed all 7 GIMP UX web design projects you’ll have mastered over a dozen keyboard shortcuts (that will help you design faster).  Plus, if you applied my suggestions and did the 7 web design assignments, you’ll have 7 UX web designs developed from YOUR creative vision to use in your portfolio.  All of which, can be submitted to our QA section for feedback or just to show off your new UX web design skills!Learn GIMP web design by doing!

By doing this, we will complete objectives 11, 12, 13 and parts of 6 and 18 from the 70-461 exam.Session 5We'll will now be creating aggregate queries, working through objective 9 of the exam 70-461. We'll be reviewing the ranking functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK and NTILE. We'll look at the 8 analytic functions news to SQL Server 2012, such as LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.We'll look at alternative ways of grouping and adding totals, using ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS and GROUPING_ID. If you want to take the 70-461 exam, we'll also look at the geometry and geography data types, plotting locations on a grid, together with functions and aggregates.Session 6We'll will now be creating sub-queries, working through objectives 7b-e of the exam 70-461. We'll be created correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We'll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we'll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.We'll be looking at functions (objective 14), including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We'll then complete objective 6 by looking at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and objective 8 by looking at the use of GUIDs. We'll also look at sequences. We'll have a look at XML. Finally, for SQL Server 2016 and later (exam 70-761), we'll examine JSON and Temporal Tables.Session 7In this session we'll be looking at transactions, seeing how to explicitly start and end them, and finding out how they can block other users in the database. Then we'll see about how to indexes and their role in optimising queries. We'll also see how we can use Dynamic Management Views to see how we can improve our use of indexes. We'll then look at how to write a cursor, and when to use this row-based operation, and the impact of using scalar UDFs.No prior knowledge is required - I'll even show you how to install SQL Server on your computer for free!There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.Once finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in T-SQL.

However, the information in this course is still relevant to DBA.Do you want to gain practical experience in Database Administration in SQLServer?Welcome.In this course, learn some of the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV or resume, and even go for the official Microsoft certification.SQLServer is one of the main database tools that is requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to do DBA for SQLServer could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.We'll download and install for free SQLServer Developer, which gives you all of the capabilities of the full-cost Enterprise edition (though without being able to use it for commercial purposes). We'll start by downloading a demonstration database, and learning how to backup and restore this database, and what recovery models are appropriate for other databases, to enable you to offer Point in Time recovery.We'll manage logins and server roles, so you can control who gets access to what data, implement and maintain indexes, so you can speed up searches, and import and export data. We'll look at managing SQLServer Agent, so you can automate routine tasks, and also be alerted to problems, we'll manage and configure databases, and look at compression, both of which aids with administrating big databases. And much more.The course will take around 10 hours to complete,but completing this will enable you to versed in Database Administration tasks, giving you hands-on experience.The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll manually backup a database, but then later we'll use SQLServer Agent to automate this. In this course, we will only do activities that require one computer, instead of multiple servers or virtualization.The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual DBA will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.No knowledge of T-SQLis required, as I'll demonstrate everything Ican through the GUI(Graphical User Interface) as well as T-SQL.

If this issue doesn't directly affect me, why should I care?



The truth is you don't know that no one in your life is transgender and there's a very good chance that if you've said anything remotely like the above to them, they might never feel safe enough to tell you. 



A Beginner's Guide to Trans 101 is the very basic foundation for developing cultural competence in working with transgender individuals. With the increased visibility of the transgender community more industries and individuals are finding the need to increase their knowledge and understanding of issues that effect the transgender community. 



It is important to learn appropriate and inappropriate ways to interact with members of the community so that your communication can be positive, non-stigmatizing and successful. And, well, just basically not be jerk.

Video lectures are great for learning concepts, but can be difficult to skim through later when you're trying to remember what you learned. Because of this, this course includes video lectures AND written articles. Nearly every video is accompanied with a written article so you can reinforce your learning, and have an easy way to skim through and study the tougher concepts.

From the educational side, it boosts people's understanding by simplifying many complex concepts. From the industry point of view, models are much easier to understand, maintain, and develop.Deep Learning is one of the fastest growing areas of Artificial Intelligence. In the past few years, we have proven that Deep Learning models, even the simplest ones, can solve very hard and complex tasks. Now, that the buzz-word period of Deep Learning has, partially, passed, people are releasing its power and potential for their product improvements.The course is structured in a way to cover all topics from neural network modeling and training to put it in production.In Part 1 of the course, you will learn about the technology stack that we will use throughout the course (Section 1) and the TensorFlow 2.0 library basics and syntax (Section 2).In Part 2 of the course, we will dig into the exciting world of deep learning. Through this part of the course, you will implement several types of neural networks (Fully Connected Neural Network (Section 3), Convolutional Neural Network (Section 4), Recurrent Neural Network (Section 5)). At the end of this part, Section 6, you will learn and build their own Transfer Learning application that achieves state of the art (SOTA) results on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.After passing the part 2 of the course and ultimately learning how to implement neural networks, in Part 3 of the course, you will learn how to make your own Stock Market trading bot using Reinforcement Learning, specifically Deep-Q Network.Part 4 is all about TensorFlow Extended (TFX). In this part of the course, you will learn how to work with data and create your own data pipelines for production. In Section 8 we will check if the dataset has any anomalies using the TensorFlow Data Validation library and after learn how to check a dataset for anomalies, in Section 9, we will make our own data preprocessing pipeline using the TensorFlow Transform library.In Section 10 of the course, you will learn and create your own Fashion API using the Flask Python library and a pre-trained model. Throughout this section, you will get a better picture of how to send a request to a model over the internet. However, at this stage, the architecture around the model is not scalable to millions of request. Enter the Section 11. In this section of the course, you will learn how to improve solution from the previous section by using the TensorFlow Serving library. In a very easy way, you will learn and create your own Image Classification API that can support millions of requests per day!These days it is becoming more and more popular to have a Deep Learning model inside an Android or iOS application, but neural networks require a lot of power and resources! That's where the TensorFlow Lite library comes into play. In Section 12 of the course, you will learn how to optimize and convert any neural network to be suitable for a mobile device.To conclude with the learning process and the Part 5 of the course, in Section 13 you will learn how to distribute the training of any Neural Network to multiple GPUs or even Servers using the TensorFlow 2.0 library.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-2/,785,Machine Learning,133,120,"Hadelin de Ponteves

278,4221858,A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro),"Deep learning is increasingly dominating technology and has major implications for society.From self-driving cars to medical diagnoses, from face recognition to deep fakes, and from language translation to music generation, deep learning is spreading like wildfire throughout all areas of modern technology.But deep learning is not only about super-fancy, cutting-edge, highly sophisticated applications. Deep learning is increasingly becoming a standard tool in machine-learning, data science, and statistics. Deep learning is used by small startups for data mining and dimension reduction, by governments for detecting tax evasion, and by scientists for detecting patterns in their research data.Deep learning is now used in most areas of technology, business, and entertainment. And it's becoming more important every year.How does deep learning work?Deep learning is built on a really simple principle: Take a super-simple algorithm (weighted sum and nonlinearity), and repeat it many many times until the result is an incredibly complex and sophisticated learned representation of the data.Is it really that simple?mmm OK, it's actually a tiny bit more complicated than that ;) but that's the core idea, and everything else -- literally everything else in deep learning -- is just clever ways of putting together these fundamental building blocks. That doesn't mean the deep neural networks are trivial to understand:there are important architectural differences between feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks.Given the diversity of deep learning model designs, parameters, and applications, you can only learn deep learning -- Imean, really learn deep learning, not just have superficial knowledge from a youtube video -- by having an experienced teacher guide you through the math, implementations, and reasoning. And of course, you need to have lots of hands-on examples and practice problems to work through. Deep learning is basically just applied math, and, as everyone knows, math is not a spectator sport!What is this course all about?Simply put:The purpose of this course is to provide a deep-dive into deep learning. You will gain flexible, fundamental, and lasting expertise on deep learning. You will have a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts in deep learning, so that you will be able to learn new topics and trends that emerge in the future.Please note:This is not a course for someone who wants a quick overview of deep learning with a few solved examples. Instead, this course is designed for people who really want to understand how and why deep learning works; when and how to select metaparameters like optimizers, normalizations, and learning rates; how to evaluate the performance of deep neural network models; and how to modify and adapt existing models to solve new problems.You can learn everything about deep learning in this course.In this course, you will learn Theory:Why are deep learning models built the way they are? Math:What are the formulas and mechanisms of deep learning?Implementation:How are deep learning models actually constructed in Python (using the PyTorch library)?Intuition: Why is this or that metaparameter the right choice? How to interpret the effects of regularization?etc.Python:If you're completely new to Python, go through the 8+ hour coding tutorial appendix. If you're already a knowledgeable coder, then you'll still learn some new tricks and code optimizations.Google-colab:Colab is an amazing online tool for running Python code, simulations, and heavy computations using Google's cloud services. No need to install anything on your computer.Unique aspects of this courseClear and comprehensible explanations of concepts in deep learning.Several distinct explanations of the same ideas, which is a proven technique for learning.Visualizations using graphs, numbers, and spaces that provide intuition of artificial neural networks.LOTSof exercises, projects, code-challenges, suggestions for exploring the code. You learn best by doing it yourself!Active QA forum where you can ask questions, get feedback, and contribute to the community.8+ hour Python tutorial. That means you don't need to master Python before enrolling in this course.So what are you waiting for??Watch the course introductory video and free sample videos to learn more about the contents of this course and about my teaching style.

286,1122334,A Practical Introduction to Cloud Computing,"The 2nd top hit for 'Cloud Computing' on Google says 'Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet.' Unfortunately, that definition is completely wrong.

This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.















And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.















I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.















Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listing the Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.















You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different models and then dive deep into the details and options of each. I also give lab demos of how to deploy each type.















The Cloud Deployment Models of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.















Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet to show you how to do a TCO cost comparison when choosing between an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.















A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivation to complete further training and be a real asset to their company.
















As a student in this course, you will get an answer to every question you ask in the Ask Question section. I love interaction with my students- anything you want to know, please ask.

287,3531076,A Professional Introduction to Scrum,"Are you and your team exhausted and frustrated because you are juggling multiple projects and constantly task-switching? Does working this way make it difficult to understand progress or to feel a sense of purpose in your daily work? How often do you discover that what you delivered doesn't achieve desired outcomes? Does quality often get sacrificed under pressure to do more faster? If you are looking for a better way to approach complex work and deliver high value solutions, Scrum is the way. Scrum done well enables business agility, which is essential in our unpredictable and rapidly changing world. Scrum is a framework that helps people productively and creatively solve complex problems and deliver greater value. Scrum enables you to deliver Increments of value working in short cycles. This approach helps you incorporate learning as you do the work, get feedback frequently to make sure you are on the right track, and respond quickly to change.Icreated this Udemy course for you - filled with my unique insights as a licensed Professional Scrum Trainer, Steward of the Professional Scrum Master (PSM)curriculum, and owner of an agility training and coaching business. I have taught over 1,300 students on 5 continents. I am co-author of the book Mastering Professional Scrum, published in 2019 by Pearson Addison-Wesley. Iam also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and started my career working in traditional project management, which gives me a unique perspective to help people understand the difference and make the transition to Scrum and agility if it makes sense for them.Note:This course is up-to-date with the 2020 Scrum Guide.Scrum may have its roots in software, but it has been used well beyond software for decades. I designed the course to help you apply Scrum in any context - from operations to marketing, from projects and products to research and problem solving, and even running departments or entire organizations. Ioffer a wide range of examples to help you see how the concepts can be applied for different types of work.Student Review --""This was a phenomenal course. Stephanie's lectures were fun to watch, and it's clear she knows her material. She spoke at a cadence that was easy to follow, and you can tell she's into what she's teaching. I found her guides to be very helpful and highly recommend signing up for her newsletter. I look forward to taking more courses from Stephanie in the future.""This course is built to help you learn Scrum the right way - in alignment with the official Scrum Guide and leveraging the foundational values and principles. Zero previous Scrum experience is required. In fact, it is often beneficial to have zero experience because you won't have as much to unlearn. In my experience, there are many misunderstandings and myths about Scrum that prevent teams from applying Scrum well and gaining the benefits of agility. This course can also serve as a great refresher and validation of knowledge for people who do have Scrum experience but little to no professional Scrum training. In this course, you will learn to: Identify the key differences between a traditional plan-driven approach and an agile value-driven approachShift your mindset towards an agile way of thinkingDefine the roles, artifacts, and events of the Scrum framework, the importance of each one, and how they all fit together to maximize value deliveryLeverage empiricism and the Scrum values to navigate challenges and maximize the benefits of ScrumDetermine when to use ScrumDefine and meaure valueCreate and evolve a definition of ""Done""Break out of the mindset of focusing on tasks and deliverables and see opportunity to deliver value in entirely new waysRethink how you can iteratively and incrementally deliver valueApply the Goldilocks Principle to Product Backlog RefinementMake the minimal decisions needed to get started with ScrumEstimate and forecast using agile techniquesAvoid using velocity in the wrong waysLeverage an agile approach to managing budgets and schedulesApply my model for improving your Scrum implementation (because there are no best practices when dealing with complex work)Get additional resources to go deeper in your learningAgility is essential in today's environment. Agility is the real competitive advantage. Teams and organizations must be nimble, creative, and resilient in order to effectively navigate complexity and thrive in a constantly changing world. Scrum is used by over 12 million people around the world. While Scrum does have its origins in software development, it has been used well beyond software for decades as more and more teams and organizations have realized their work is complex and their environment is unpredictable and rapidly changing. I offer a wide range of examples to help people understand the concepts and how to apply in their own context.Throughout the course, you will have opportunities to reflect on questions that will help bring the course concepts to life in your own context. Ihave included two canvasesIuse with my coaching clients that will help you start applying Scrum in your work environment. And for those of you who are eager to take your learning deeper, I'll guide you toward next steps.This course is different because it is true to the Scrum Guide and Ken Schwaber's vision, and it is not prescriptive. Agile is not a silver bullet. Scrum is a framework - not a methodology - that leverages the power of a small, self-organizing team. The Scrum Team decides their process within the framework, and that process will evolve as they inspect and adapt, learn and grow. There are no best practices in Scrum because we are dealing with complexity. Best practices only exist in simple environments. A lot of the information you find online and even what is delivered in training does not clarify what is required by Scrum versus what is an example or personal opinion. I aim to teach you the foundational knowledge you need to effectively navigate in your own context. Iprovide examples of helpful practices and advice from my own experience, however, Imake clear distinctions and help you understand why you might use a practice and the benefits it can provide.When applied with discipline and intention, Scrum helps you confidently navigate complexity and uncertainty, deliver greater value, and thrive in a constantly changing world.Are you in for that?Enroll today and begin your Scrum journey with me!(Trust a former project manager and perfectionist...

317,285610,A+ Essays: A Structured Approach to Successful Essay Writing,"Many students become anxious at the prospect of having to write an essay or term paper. They don't understand the conventions for organizing essays, and they don't know how to manage their time and the writing process. The result is that many students enter college without the skills necessary to succeed simply because they were never properly taught how to write essays. This course aims to overcome this problem by offering a systematic framework for essay writing that removes the mystery and presents a clear path for moving from idea to outline to completed first draft. A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO SUCCESSFUL ESSAY WRITINGThe most efficient way to improve your essay writing is to focus on the key structural features that define successful writing at the essay level. An essay can be written beautifully, but if it's missing key structural elements (like a well defined thesis statement), it will fail as an essay.This course provides a set of concepts and tools for thinking about, analyzing and fixing problems with the structural elements of your essay. CONTENTS AND OVERVIEWStudents in this course will learn how essay writing skills are related to ""deep reading"" and ""deep thinking"" skills, and why this is increasingly important in today's world. You will also learn how standards of good essay writing are related to standards of good written communication more broadly. You'll learn why academic essays are structured the way they are, how essay style is related to essay structure, how to approach the writing process, and how to organize your time so that you can actually get the work done before the deadline.But the centerpiece of the course is two detailed case studies. In one of them I take a short student essay that has some serious problems, analyze the structural issues and rewrite that essay from start to finish. In another case study I take an actual essay assignment from an actual college class, that I don't teach, and take that essay from initial brainstorming and researching to a detailed outline to a completed first draft with a reference list and inline reference citations.At the end of this course you will feel more confident about your ability to successfully complete essay assignments in school, and you will have a greater understanding of the skills and habits of successful writers.

That is because WANs designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of WAN traffic that cloud adoption brings. That traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability.Further, opening the enterprise to the Internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. It is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce, including employees, partners, contractors, vendors, and guests. Enabling broadband on the WAN makes the security requirements more acute, creating challenges for IT in balancing user experience, security, and complexity.The new WANNew business models drive the need for a new network model.SD-WAN addresses the current IT challenges. This new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. Network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data privacy.What are the benefits of SD-WAN?The traditional WAN architecture was limited to enterprise, branch, and data center. Once an organization adopts cloud-based applications in the form of SaaS and IaaS, its WAN architecture experiences an explosion of traffic accessing applications distributed across the globe.These changes have multiple implications for IT. Employee productivity may be compromised by SaaS-application performance problems. WAN expenses can rise with inefficient use of dedicated and backup circuits. IT fights a daily, complex battle of connecting multiple types of users with multiple types of devices to multiple cloud environments.With SD-WAN, IT can deliver routing, threat protection, efficient offloading of expensive circuits, and simplification of WAN network management. Business benefits can include the following:Better application experienceHigh availability, with predictable service, for all critical enterprise applicationsMultiple hybrid active-active links for all network scenariosDynamically routed application traffic with application-aware routing, for efficient delivery and improved user experienceImproved OpEx, replacing expensive Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) services with more economical and flexible broadband (including secure VPN connections)More securityApplication-aware policies with end-to-end segmentation and real-time access controlIntegrated threat protection enforced at the right placeSecure traffic across broadband Internet and into the cloudDistribute security to the branch and remote endpoints with NGFW, DNS security, and NGAVOptimized cloud connectivitySeamless extension of the WAN to multiple public cloudsReal-time optimized performance for Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, and other major SaaS applicationsOptimized workflows for cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft AzureSimplified managementA single, centralized, cloud-delivered management dashboard for configuration and management of WAN, cloud, and securityTemplate-based, zero-touch provisioning for all locations: branch, campus, and cloudDetailed reporting of application and WAN performance for business analytics and bandwidth forcasting",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/abc-of-cisco-sdwan-viptela-redundancy-routing-policy/,596,Network & Security,55,55,"Ratnesh K - 20,000+ Students Worldwide","This is for network engineers , my course abc of Cisco SDWAN Viptela required prior to take this course.","Will Come to know how software define Wide Area Network, Redundancy , Routing & Policies Works",en_US,False,IT Operations,Network & Security,0,0,True,English [Auto],596

365,1958472,"Acoustic Guitar Redefined. Learn Chords, Rhythm and Melody!","ACOUSTIC GUITAR REDEFINED is a course for any guitar player who wants to learn how to play chords, melody, and rhythm creatively and practically. If you are tired of playing the same static, boring chords over and over and you want to find a way to make your acoustic guitar sound more interesting without necessarily having to learn crazy stuff, then this program is definitely for you. AS A GUITAR TEACHER, I GET THIS QUESTION A LOT: ""Hey Marco, I have been playing guitar for a while, but I am stuck in a guitar rot. I want to learn a different way of playing chords and melodies to get my motivation back. What should I do and which guitar lessons should I follow?"" If this is your situation, you can do three things: Number 1: You can go on social media and try to figure things out yourself. Places such as YouTube are great, but it can be overwhelming to navigate through thousands of videos for some people. If you want to have access to a vast amount of guitar lessons at zero cost, social media is excellent. If you want a structured program, you should avoid this step.Number 2: Private teachers still represent the best way to learn guitar. You could get assessed by a professional guitar teacher who will fix bad habits, come up with a structured program, and follow you step by step. However, private tutors can be quite expensive. You will also have to deal with location and availability. If you don't have much time available, this option doesn't work. Number 3: You could find an excellent online guitar course that fits your music style. A good online guitar course is perfect if you don't have much time available and want to practice from home. Most of the time, online guitar lessons are way cheaper than private lessons. The only downside is that you don't have support, and most of your questions will be unanswered. Also, some courses can be quite slow to follow. With Acoustic Guitar Redefined, I did my best to put together a practical acoustic guitar course that will teach you how to spice things up in your playing without ""talking"" too much. In each module, you will learn how to practice, play, and then transform simple chord progressions. There are three levels for each module: The Basic level, in which I will show you how to play the chords using the fingerpicking technique. The Rhythmic level, where we will then add the percussive technique. And the Melodic level, where we will be learning a simple yet beautiful melody over the chords.

O que eu acho sensacional no seu método é que sua ênfase é na fotografia e não no Lightroom. Ao invés de usar todo tempo explicando tudo sobre a interface, os recursos e as ferramentas do Ligthroom, ele pega casos reais de imagens que precisam de algum tratamento (muito claras ou muito escuras, com muita ou pouca cor, deformadas pela lente, perspectiva errada, com muito ruído, embaçadas, etc) e mostra como trata-las, corrigindo-as, melhorando-as e deixando-as mais interessantes usando essas ferramentas, o que afinal é o propósito do software e o motivo de precisarmos dele. No processo vamos sendo apresentados ao Lightroom e aprendendo a usa-lo naturalmente.

This is hands down the best Training Course on Photoshop. I've always felt scared of learning and using Photoshop.

506,2740930,Advanced AI For Games with Goal-Oriented Action Planning,"Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an AI architecture that provides game characters with the ability to select goals and make plans to achieve those goals based on the state of the environment and available resources. It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large finite state machines. The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful. The library is written in C# and implemented in Unity V.2019, however will easily port to other applications.In this course, Penny demystifies the advanced AI technique of GOAP used for creating believable and intelligent game characters in gamesusing her internationally acclaimed teaching style andknowledge from over 25 years working with games,graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI.Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own GOAP API. You will build the entire GOAP library from the ground up while building a hospital simulation scenario in parallel, to test the API as you go.Learn how to program and work with:A GOAP Library and API that's reusable across a wide range of game projects.Goals, Actions, States and Beliefs that define the state of the game environment, what individual characters want to do and how they understand their world.Navigation Meshes and Agents that provide advanced path planning and navigation capabilities for characters.Dynamic Building of NavMeshes to allow for the repositioning of resources in the environment.Inventories for each character for use in completing tasks that satisfy character goals.The Unity UI system to move draggable resources into a game environment.Contents and OverviewThroughout the course, you will follow along while a GOAP library and API are constructed from the ground up, to allow you intimate knowledge of the codebase. Alongside this, a simple hospital simulation will be constructed to test out the functionality of the library as it is put together. The simulation will also rely on Unity's NavMesh System for navigation and path planning.The course begins with an overview of Unity's NavMesh System and covers the basic functionality needed for the hospital simulation. It then goes on to cover the concept of GOAP, where students will discover how goals, actions and plans interact. A planner will be constructed that dynamically builds each character's sequence of actions, based on what they believe their goals are while in the simulation.Following this, inventories will be introduced and developed to hold resources for individual characters. The resources in the inventories will be required for plan completion and also assist in directing a character's navigation around the environment. This will then build to the design of more complex behaviours in which two characters must collaborate to complete a plan. As the course continues, more characters with differing roles will be added and dynamically created and resources will be added and removed to develop a complex simulation. By the end of the course, students will have a hospital simulation with patients, nurses, doctors and janitors each with their own roles, goals, actions and required resources. Although this course is not about building a completed game, a final section will provide some further knowledge on Unity development and examine methods for interacting with the environment such as: dragging and dropping items, dynamic NavMesh baking, user interface creation and camera movement to provide students with some direction on how such a simulation could be turned into a game.At the completion of this course, students will have a fully-fledged GOAP library and API that they can reuse in their own game projects to provide game characters with complex intelligent behaviours.What students are saying about Penny's courses:Turns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.I honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ai_with_goap/,487,Game Development,40,39,"Penny de Byl

510,1196460,Advanced Android - Architecture with Dagger 2 and more,"Hello everyone and thank you for your interest in Advanced Android!

Android development has a lot of great benefits, such as low barrier to entry, low cost to be a published developer, and of course, being able to run your creations on millions of devices.





























Developing a maintainable and testable application that is easy to add new features to can be difficult. It requires thinking ahead about the architecture of your application and getting beyond the “just make it work” stage. This is something I personally find the most fun about development, however. My goal is to help you get into the same mindset and teach you about architecture patterns that will accomplish the previously mentioned items.





























This course is an intermediate course, so familiarity with the Android development process will help greatly. It will move quickly, but advanced concepts will be explained thoroughly. That said, we will be building an application from the very beginning, so by following along, no matter what your skill level, you will be able to complete this course and have a fully functioning Android app with the kind of architecture that you would hope to see in an enterprise level project. That’s not to say that all companies have applications with great architecture (if only we developers could be so lucky), but after this course you will be able to identify if a project doesn’t—and have an idea on how to fix it!





























Here are some of the things you will learn in this course:



























Dependency Injection with Dagger 2Making network requests with RetrofitUnit testing with Junit and MockitoUsing test doubles in Espresso tests with Dagger 2MVP / MVVM architecture (yes, a mixture! Read below for details) using Reactive View Models





























In regards to the MVP / MVVM architecture point:



























The classic software architecture patterns are baseline frameworks attempting to describe how layers of your software communicate with each other. It is important to remember that forming the patterns to what works best for you is the key; as long as you follow basic software architecture principles, any architecture is a good architecture! In this course you will learn how using Reactive View Models with Presenters can help you separate responsibilities and make your application much easier to test.





























With all that said I’m excited to get started showing you how to create applications that will make your life, and those of the developers following you, easier and more enjoyable!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/advanced-android/,467,Mobile Development,90,64,Brandon Gogetap,"Intermediate Android development experience

Students should have familiarity with writing proofs and mathematical notation.Basically just,1) Watch the videos, and try to follow along with a pencil and paper, take notes! 2) Try to learn to write the proofs as I do. If you understand the proofs then you have learned a great deal. If you can write the proofs on your own then you have really graduated to the next level.3) Repeat!If you finish even 50% of this course you will know ALOT of Advanced Calculus and more importantly your level of mathematical maturity will go up tremendously!Advanced Calculus is a beautiful yet notoriously difficult subject to learn and teach.

Depending upon the cost and model, one car can equipped from one to many ADAS functions which work to assist drivers on road and help to prevent danger situations which can cause fatal accidents. From last many years, automotive companies are working hard to bring advancement in available ADAS systems and also to develop many new. According to the SAE levels defined for Autonomous Driving vehicles, ADAS plays prominent role to develop AD technology. Hence, if you are working in automotive industry (on any profile) or you are student who is dreaming to follow your passion in this industry, then gaining insights of the ADAS systems is very important. Even though this technology is widely adapted, the literature and good explanation of major ADAS systems is rarely available at one place. When I started in Automotive Industry, I struggled a lot in my initial months, to understand and gather all the knowledge which can help me to work smoothly on the topics. In last few years, I have supervised many intern and thesis students and I had come across with the same questions by almost everyone. Even many times, people working in the industry, do not clearly understand this topic or sometimes mix one ADAS system with another and gets confused.To overcome all these issues and to help to gain knowledge in this area, I have developed this course with concise content. This course will help you to understand about their origin, their role in AD, various sensors used in ADAS, role of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in ADAS, how they are tested in Industry and explanation of more than 20 ADAS systems which includes all major ADAS available in market with animations, industrial applications and block diagrams.Kindly note that, This course is theoretical but contains lot of industrial examples to provide practical understanding of the field. It contains Quiz at the end of most of the sections to check your understanding of concepts.Course provides (completely optional) programming activities to develop and test some ADAS systems in Python. But these activities are not required to completely understand the content of this course and hence can be skipped. But if you are interested, you can give a try. Disclaimer: 1. During the course, many animations and videos from different car manufacturers are used. But they are only for education purpose and taken from sources which are available to public. I have no intention to market any kind of Technology through this course. 2.

Advanced Excelusers, always find the optimal solution for every task, and they find it fast!What differentiates this Microsoft Excelcourse from the others?The reason I created this specific Advanced Excel course,is because there are many advanced Excel users who are unaware ofkey features  formulas in Excel. I understand that when you take an Excel training it can be so broad, and a lot of courses cover too many topics. It’s easy to get lost. You might also not immediately appreciate why some features are useful and how you can practically apply them. We are creatures of habit and it’s difficult to get our head around learning new techniques. As a result you might be missing out on some features that can majorly simplify the way you use Excel.Differentiation factor #1Focus - The top 10 brings focus to the key Excel features which will provide you with a solid  a strong foundation in Excel. Differentiation factor #2Learn by doing - This Advanced Microsoft Excel courseis well structured and organized.

525,1322060,"Advanced Excel Power Query-M language, troubleshoot, Pattern","Hello and welcome to Excel Power Query Advanced course.At the outset I thank you for showing interest in this course.

 In this video I will provide overview of all the contents of this course and what are basic requirements before you enroll into this course. So let’s get started.

 There are four major areas I will be covering as part of this course. The first one is for troubleshooting the Power Query errors and workaround for limitation of Power Query. In real any software is not foolproof and has its own limitation. Also, if you don’t use the software as programmed you may encounter errors. And I hope you would agree that error codes or description in most of the software are not that user friendly or they do not provide appropriate solution to resolve the error. Hence in this first section I will show some of the common areas where you face Power Query limitation and erros. Some of them are as follows:

 Error encountered with adding / rename / deleting a particular column headings.

 Handling null values during arithmetic calculation.

 Identify error rows encountered while creating or on refresh of query.

 Multiplying effect when you JOIN queries

 Issues with filters and how to use advanced filters.

 Then the next area is for advanced case studies. Similar to my starter course of Excel Power Query where I have shown you more than 20+ real life case studies of applying power query, here also I have taken some real life case studies which require some more in depth knowledge of Power Query and workaround. This section will be updated new case studies as and when I see some interesting datasets. The current video are related to 

 Applying local setting when converting the dates fields

 Leave dataset which needed leave details to be broken into separate rows from a single cell.

 Unstack the dataset which has uneven details

 Combine multiple rows data back to single cell.

 Then next section is for advanced M concepts. Here I will give you more information related to M Language in Power Query. What syntax is to be used under advanced editor. How to create parameters and use it inside your power query. How to create new custom M function using PQ interface or through advanced editor. I will also show how you can troubleshoot the custom M function you have created using advanced editor. Then I will show you how you can organize your multiple queries in separate groups. Further I will also show how to use Query Dependency view which will give you visual presentation of all the queries inside your excel file. This will help you understand the flow of all the data from source till the final output, where it is loaded or which queries are referenced to each other. All precedents and dependents to your queries can be easily identified.

 And now finally in last section I will be providing some readymade patterns for power query. I will provide all the power query code which you can copy paste into your file and start using it. You will not need to create any new query for these patterns. Since creating these patterns using power query requires lot of efforts and also very complex I am providing you these as ready to use.

 So now before you enroll I would like to tell you that there are few requirements.

 First one is that you should have latest version of Power Query installed if you are using Excel 2010 / 2013 or if you are using Excel 2016 then it should be updated.

557,3784430,Advanced SQL Database Administration with MySQL Workbench,"MySQL is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing relational databases, and a skill that every analyst and BI professional should have in the arsenal. In this course, you'll take your database administration skills to the next level, expanding into advanced concepts like replication, automation, and database security.We'll start by introducing the course structure, installing MySQL Community and Workbench, and reviewing key database administration (DBA) tasks; creating and editing schemas  tables, inserting and deleting records, and reviewing the key principles of normalized databases. From there we'll work through more advanced concepts like replication, backup and recovery, and learn how to leverage automation via stored procedures, triggers, and scheduled events. Throughout the course, you'll be playing the role of Lead Database Administrator for an e-commerce startup, and learn how to build and populate an entire database from the ground up using real-world projects and assignments.COURSEOUTLINE:SQLIntro MySQLSetupFor students who haven't completed one of our other SQL courses, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQLCommunity Server MySQLWorkbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac  PC, and run our first piece of SQLcode to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.Importing Data to the Database We'll quickly review some basic concepts like creating, inserting, and deleting records. Then we'll learn how to tackle large data imports with ease, using the table data import wizard. We'll be using this handy tool throughout the course. You will construct and populate a database from the ground up as the business grows, just like a real DBAas part of the course project. Altering, Updating Mapping KeysWe'll briefly review critical concepts like altering tables and updating records, discuss the ins and outs of primary and foreign keys, and from there you'll jump right into your assignments and quizzes for this section. Replication, Backup RecoveryHere we'll introduce the critical DBAconcepts of replication, backup and recovery. We'll discuss the various benefits of replication, different methods of backing up your databases, and you'll learn how to restore your data should the need arise. This is getting into some pretty serious stuff!***MID-COURSEPROJECTYou will need all of the skills you've learned so far to complete this hands on mid-course project. You'll help your CEO by enhancing the data structure to accommodate changing business needs, and insert new data into various places within your database. Trigger AutomationHere we'll dive into one of the most powerful automation tools you'll use as a DBA...triggers!You'll learn how you can create triggers to look for changes in the database via create, update, and delete statements, and then automatically enact changes on one of more of your tables. Triggers will be your best friend as a DBA, and can be extremely handy for Analysts to understand as well. Creating ViewsSometimes you don't need to create a table, and a view (aka ""a virtual table)is a better option. We'll walk through what views are, how you create them, and some of the major benefits of using views in certain situations. The EERDiagram EditorOne of the best tools at your disposal for understanding your database and communicating its structure to others in your organization is leveraging EERDiagrams. We'll review some of the basics that we discussed in the Beginner course, and we'll also learn how to use the EERDiagram Editor to reverse engineer your schema, which is an extremely handy tool!Stored Procedures Scheduled EventsNext, we'll dive deeper into automation by learning how to create stored procedures and scheduled events. If you liked triggers, you're going to love these!You can use stored procedures to simplify your processes, make your code more modular and easier to understand, and centralize certain parts of complex queries that you can leverage throughout your organization. Scheduled events will allow you to run one-time or recurring processes on your database, which you can schedule on whatever cadence you want. These are really fun!Automating Data from Website ActivityHere we'll be talking about the different types of data businesses typically track from their website activity, including traffic source data, on-site behavior, product purchases, and more. We'll discuss the various methods used to capture the various data types, and discuss the DBA's role in partnering with Engineering to make sure this is all working as it should. Database SecurityIn the last section before the final project, we'll discuss some of the most common types of database security threats you should be aware of as a DBA, as well as security best practices to mitigate your risk. Again, we'll discuss the DBA's role in the organization, how a DBAwill partner with Engineering here, and who typically owns what. ***FINALCOURSEPROJECTThis hands-on project will test all of your DBAskills. You will need to alter tables, import lots of data, design an optimal structure for an entirely new set of tables for a new business initiative, create an EERDiagram describing your new tables, and then you'll actually create them. After that, you'll need to create a stored procedure and a view, which will both used for reporting on the new data the company will be collecting.Finally, you'll need to come up with a comprehensive security plan to make sure your organization is aware of threats and following best practices. Iknow this sounds like a lot, but at this point you'll be ready for it!IMPORTANTNOTE:This course does NOTgo deep on data exploration and database analysis.

Good course."" -- Mike H""Excellent material and quick to the point!""-- Nick Y. COURSEINTRODUCTION:Welcome to Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis.  In this course, we are going to take a deep dive into analyzing the transaction log. The SQL Server transaction log contains the history of every action that modified anything in the database. Before data is written or saved on disk a copy or record of that transaction is first written to the transaction log.  This is part of the D in the ACID properties. Recall that D stands for durability and durability is the ACID property which guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently.  For example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes. This process in SQL Server is accomplished by WAL or Write Ahead Logging.  SQL Server uses a write-ahead log (WAL), which guarantees that no data modifications are written to disk before the associated log record is written to disk. No matter what you’ve read about non-logged operations the truth is that every user transactions that modifies an internal SQL Server object is logged.  In the course we will learn how WAL works for SQL Srever and some internal architecture on how this is accomplished.  Thanks for your interest in Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis and we will see you in the course.

If you are a passionate Tableau user and you can associate yourself with one or more of the questions above, then this course is for you. Scenarios like the ones mentioned above occur on a daily basis, and they can cause quite a bit of headache for the analyst. Tableau has many great tools and functions including table calculations that make everyday life easier for the data scientist.



One strong point of the software is its responsiveness. Plotting measures against variables has never been easier: each change to the shelves is instantly and automatically applied on the view - a great environment to interact with the data.

  This strong point, however, can easily be turned into a weakness, if you want your analysis to step out of the borders of the view level of detail.



In Tableau, to solve classic analytical problems (such as cohort analysis, retention analysis or binning aggregates by dimensions), or to proceed with special filtering scenarios (like proportional brushing or relative comparisons) you need to be familiar with a special tool set called the level of detail (LOD) expressions.



In this course, you will learn about the general mechanics of LOD expressions both in theory and practice. We start from the very basics and then we proceed to more advanced techniques in a stepwise manner. If you are not familiar with the concept of LOD expressions yet, but you are already a Tableau user, then taking this course will most probably improve your analytical skills and broaden your tool set.



After completing this course, you will be able to solve all above mentioned analytical challenges and even more, because LOD expressions let the analyst come up with creative solutions for custom scenarios. Instead of asking the questions you can be the one in the office who always has a practical answer or a constructive idea. Take a look at the content of this course, and I bet you won’t regret it.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/advanced-tableau-level-of-detail-expressions-tableau-lod/,373,Analytics Data Visualization,45,44,R-Tutorials Training,"Basic understanding of Tableau

565,2475998,Advanced Training for Trauma Treatment of Complex PTSD,"Presenter: Dr. J. Eric Gentry, Ph.D., LMHC, D.A.A.E.T.S.While the focus of the CCTS-I was to acquire the basic skills for treating post traumatic stress, the focus of the Complex PTSD training is acquiring skills for effectively treating those challenging clients with complex post traumatic stress, or C-PTSD. C-PTSD can present with a myriad of difficult symptoms including intense abreactions/flashbacks; severe “depression-like” shutdown and avoidance; dissociation; relational difficulties and challenges; chronic emotional and somatic dysregulation; chronic pain; and psychotic symptoms. This course provides comprehensive presentation of clinical skills for screening/assessing, stabilizing, skills-building, and treating complex post traumatic stress in all its challenging presentations. Focusing upon working in a tri-phasic model, the participant will learn how to titrate treatment to minimize discomfort and crises while, at once, accelerating treatment gains in early, mid and latter stages of treatment. The course provides a balance of current evidence/science-based interventions and protocols paired with experiential practice wisdom from clinicians who have successfully worked with population for decades. Participants completing this course will discover a newfound sense of competency and excitement for working with these clients who, in the past, have baffled even seasoned clinicians.Learning Objectives1. Articulate the differences between simple and complex PTSD (C-PTSD) and identify the distinct challenges for diagnosis, treatment planning, stabilization and treatment of C-PTSD.2. Understand the neurobiology of C-PTSD and how chronic exposure to threatening environments can produce the spectrum of symptoms of C-PTSD3. Appreciate the role that attachment trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) play in risk for and creation of C-PTSD; and how successfully addressing attachment issues can accelerate treatment for C-PTSD.4. Articulate the causes of attachment trauma (e.g., relational threat/anxious attachment; avoidant attachment; disorganized attachment) and how these adaptations are easily misunderstood as personality disorders.5. Articulate the importance of neuroplasticity/pruning and understanding neuronal sequencing (i.e., “neural networks”) in treating C-PTSD and all post traumatic conditions.6. Understand the important role that conditioned threat response and subsequent ANS dysregulation play in generating and sustaining the symptoms of all post traumatic conditions including C-PTSD.7. Expanded knowledge of the science and applicability of Porges’ Polyvagal Theory to treatment with C-PTSD; specifically the importance of developing and utilizing healthy attachment relationships to augment treatment.8. Articulate and explain how dissociation symptoms (e.g., numbing; derealization; depersonalization; hearing “voices”; fractured multiple ego-states; dissociative identity) are adaptations to recurring (usually developmental) trauma.9. Identify evidence-based pharmacological interventions for stabilization and treatment for clients with C-PTSD.10. Apply Herman’s Tri-Phasic Model to conceptualization, titration and delivery of treatment for C- PTSD.11. Identify specific assessment and treatment tasks for each of the three phases of the Tri-Phasic Model.12. Understand symptoms of C-PTSD as adaptations to ongoing developmental trauma that can include extreme symptoms including self-injury; suicide; dissociation; numbing; addiction (process and substance); eating disordered behavior; chronic  intractable depression; hyper/hypo sexuality; and rage.13. Articulate the role of crucial non-specific factors of positive expectancy and therapeutic relationship using Feedback Informed Therapy (FIT) as central focus of treatment with C-PTSD.14. Learn and appreciate the pivotal role of psychoeducation in treating C-PTSD to help survivors to begin to honor their survival, ameliorate shame and move towards self-compassion.15. Learn and implement the four “common factors/active ingredients” shared by all effective trauma therapies for clients with C-PTSD.16. Appreciate the ubiquitous role of reciprocal inhibition embedded in all evidence-based trauma therapiesSkillsPreparation/Assessment/Treatment Planning/Relationship-Building1. Master self-regulation of ANS dysregulation (i.e., anxiety) for clinician resilience and optimization of treatment delivery.2. Become intentional with maximizing positive expectancy as crucial early treatment intervention for engagement and ongoing intervention to enhance outcomes.3. Informed Consent for C-PTSD4. Develop understanding and usage of various assessment tools5. First-session Interventions to enhance safety, stabilization, positive expectancy and therapeutic relationship6. Skilled implementation of Feedback Informed Therapy using Miller’s Session Rating ScaleStage I: Safety  Stabilization1. Enhance case-management skills to facilitate and co-author safety planning interventions with clients in current danger.2. Practice psychoeducational skills to help C-PTSD clients discern difference between real vs. perceived threat then coaching skills to avoid “real” danger and confront perceived threats with self-regulation (i.e, in vivo exposure).3. Develop mastery of psychoeducation/cognitive restructuring skills for reframing symptoms from shame and affliction to “over”-adaptation.4. Develop mastery for teaching and coaching self-regulation skills for clients to down-regulate negative arousal, achieve stability and begin in vivo exposure in early treatment.5. Gain generic stabilization skills for all C-PTSD clientsStage II: Remembrance  Mourning/Trauma Resolution1. Master skills for Direct Therapeutic Exposure using reciprocal inhibition with in vivo exposure as primary means for resolving symptoms in Criteria B (Intrusion), Criterion C (Avoidance), Criterion D (Negative Alterations of Cognition Mood)  Criterion E (Arousal  Reactivity) of PTSD.2. Discover CBT skills to lessen avoidance, arousal, shame, dysphoria, reactivity, and distorted thinking symptoms.3. Compare evidence-based/evidence-informed treatments currently utilized to address symptoms of C-PTSDStage III: Reconnection1. Identification of specific treatment goals and empirical markers for objectives in this final stage of treatment. This stage requires a new and additional treatment plan.2.

594,1835854,After Effects para Motion designers: Do zero ao mercado,"Eu sei que o After effects parece assustador à primeira vista. Já estive no seu lugar. Acredite, esse programa poderoso não é difícil, mas se você estudá-lo com a abordagem incorreta ele pode se tornar um labirinto monstruoso. Hoje com quase 9 anos de experiência, esse monstro foi domesticado. Mas não foi fácil,  a maioria dos cursos que eu participava não tinham uma estratégia de didática adequada. Muitos deles na maioria das vezes focavam apenas em descrever o programa de cabo a rabo sem nenhuma prática associada aos conceitos ensinados. Esse modelo de ensino, no final das contas, apenas entulhava a minha cabeça, consumia a minha energia de maneira ineficaz e me deixava desanimado para seguir em frente.Percebi que para conseguir aprender esse programa fantástico teria que desenvolver a minha própria estratégia. É justamente esse método que eu estou abrindo aqui. Esse curso foi formulado totalmente baseado nessa didática que eu desenvolvi. Funcionou perfeitamente comigo e vai funcionar para você. Graças a essa abordagem, hoje atendo clientes do mundo todo e empresas de grande porte, inclusive algumas que estão na lista da FORBES das maiores empresas do mundo.Como será?A ideia desse curso é ensinar a ferramenta com um direcionamento para a demanda do mercado real! Eu quero que você termine o curso e já esteja preparado para sair à caça de trabalho. Por isso a ideia é que ao final você tenha o seu próprio demoreel (portfolio) com os tipos de videos mais solicitados do mercado. Pois todo cliente antes de te contratar vai pedir que você mostre algum material seu que se assemelhe ao que ele está precisando. Sem ter o que mostrar, não tem cliente.Mas não se preocupe, a cada módulo vamos produzir uma categoria de animação escolhida de acordo com os tipos de animação com maior demanda no mercado: KinectType (animação com textos), whiteboard, animação de logo, animação de personagem básico e avançado, Infográficos, Vfx. Bônus:Além de tudo isso, ao final do curso vou te presentear com um bônus incrível: ""Como conseguir clientes de qualquer lugar do mundo, receber em dólar e trabalhar da sua casa"". Nesse módulo eu vou passar todo o método e estratégia que eu uso para captar clientes globais e trabalhar remotamente. Esse curso reúne tudo o que eu aprendi ao longo de 9 anos nesse mercado. Vou passar o melhor caminho para você driblar todos os erros que eu cometi.

596,2174090,After Effects: Animando Personagens do Zero ao Mercado,"Esse curso tem como objetivo central te ensinar do absoluto ZERO, como se anima personagens dentro do after effects. Nós vamos focar  nas técnicas da base essencial para você começar no mundo do motion design e aprender uma das animações mais pedidas, bem pagas e divertidas de se fazer.Esse curso é composto por 4 módulos focado nas 4 técnicas da base da animação de personagem. Cada uma delas vai ensinar como animar tipos diferentes de personagens. Combinadas elas vão te permitir animar uma infinidade de estilos desse tipo de animação.E não se preocupa que nós vamos começar do absoluto zero. Nós vamos ilustrar juntos os personagens no illustrator. Preparar ele para ser animado. Vou te mostrar como importar no after effects. Organizar o seu projeto da forma mais correta, eficiente e profissional. E finalmente em seguida vou te mostrar como animar o seu personagem.No módulo 01 nós vamos aprender animação com shapes. Uma técnica bem simples mas que você vai ver que só com ela, você já consegue animar muita coisa. Inclusive até já poderia vender para algum cliente.No módulo 02, nós vamos animar um personagem inteiro usando apenas rotação. Isso vai ampliar o seu repertório de animações, te tornando capaz de pegar uma quantidade ainda maior de tipos de trabalho.No módulo 03, nós vamos seguir para o walkcilcle ou, traduzindo, o ciclo de caminhada. Que vai te ensinar a animar um personagem andando. Essa técnica tem fama de ser muito difícil, mas nesse módulo eu vou te mostrar que não é um bicho de sete cabeças. E ao final você conseguirá animar um personagem andando sem problema algum!No módulo 4, eu já vou te ensinar a usar a mesma ferramenta que grandes profissionais da área usam: o DUIK. Depois desse módulo você verá o quanto essa ferramenta vai facilitar e evoluir o resultado do seu trabalho. Depois desses 4 módulo dificilmente você vai negar um cliente por não saber animar um personagemVou revelar todo o meu fluxo de trabalho. A forma mais eficiênte de você criar e animar um personagem.Outro ponto importante é que eu fiz questão de explicar o porquê de cada passo. Com isso você não vai apenas repetir, como nos tutoriais de youtube, você vai entender o raciocínio por detrás. O que vai te dar a capacidade de criar produzir o que vier na sua mente.Nesse curso eu fiz questão de escolher apenas animações que tenham valor de mercado. Isso significa que tudo que você aprender aqui, desde do primeiro módulo, já tem alguém querendo pagar por aquele tipo de animação. Diferente de outros cursos que ensinam coisas mirabolantes que que você nunca vai ver um cliente pedindo.Então em resumo, eu preparei esse curso aqui para que você não cometesse os erros mais comuns, que foram os meus erros também, de quem quer tentar aprender animação de personagens. Tudo que você aprender nesse curso, tem valor de mercado. Você vai aprender técnicas que são pedidas no mercado real. Eu quis projetar o meu curso assim, por que é mais estimulante para quem está aprendendo, saber que aquele tempo e dinheiro investido vai trazer um retorno financeiro. E é isso que eu mais quero para você, que depois desse curso, ou durante mesmo, você já saia conquistando clientes pra todo lado!Mas você, assim como eu ficava quando terminava um curso de AE, deve está se perguntando como faz para começar a pegar clientes. Por isso, eu decidi incluir nesse curso um BÔNUS onde eu vou te entregar todo o meu método e estratégia para conseguir clientes do mundo todo, receber em dollar e trabalhar de onde quiser! Eu vou abrir para você o meu segredo de ter liberdade e trabalhar com o que gosta! Mas não adianta saber como pegar clientes e não ter um demoreel, traduzindo, um portfolio. E aí eu entro em outro ponto importante que muitos dos meus alunos se sentem inseguros de fazer por conta própria. E com razão, eu passei exatamente por essa situação. Então eu preparei um segundo bônus. Nele eu vou te passar todos os macetes de se montar um bom portfólio. Todas as boas práticas e cuidados que você deve ter ao montar a ferramenta principal na hora de conquistar um cliente.Você verá o quanto vai valer a pena aprender esse tipo de animação. Uma das minhas maiores dores no coração era negar trabalhos super bem pagos por não ter determinação de aprender animação de personagem. Depois desse curso isso não vai acontecer com você.Você simplesmente acabará esse curso dominando um dos tipos de animação mais pedidas, bem pagas e divertidas de se fazer no mundo do motion design.Bom é isso pessoal! Você está diante de uma oportunidade de aprender animação de personagem da melhor forma possível. Esse curso vai te fazer evitar todos os erros que eu cometi. De forma enxuta e direta você vai sair desse curso dominando o essencial para começar a fazer dinheiro com esse tipo  animação. Agora a escolha está nas suas mãos, seguir por conta própria ou aprender com quem já conhece o caminho.É isso, espero te ver lá dentro do curso!

Learn to See Agile and Waterfall in a fresh new perspecttve as complementary to each other rather than competitiveMany businesses and project managers are faced with a choice of choosing a traditional plan-driven approach (or what is sometimes called “Waterfall"") or a more Agile approach for critical projects which can be a very important decision with significant business impact. However, there are many stereotypes and misconceptions that exist about both “Agile"" and “Waterfall"" that can be very confusing and misleading. As an example, many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project.Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions and:Develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about ""Agile versus Waterfall"".See these two approaches in a fresh new perspective as complementary to each other rather than competitive2. Learn how to blend the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation to get the best of both worldsRather than force-fitting a project to one of these extremes, a much better approach is to fit the methodology to the nature of the project. Sometimes that requires blending the two approaches together in the right proportions to fit the situation to get the best of both worlds. It takes more skill to do that but it definitely can be done.____________________________________________________________________________​Overall Agile Business Management Curriculum:This course is part of an overall curriculum designed for business people to effectively participate and lead in an Agile environment. Agile significantly changes the role of business people in leading and managing projects and requires a much more active business leadership role to guide the direction of projects that are in progress. The overall curriculum consists of three primary courses:​1. Agile BM 101 - Introduction to Agile Business Management (this course)This course povides a solid foundation for the other courses in this overall curriculum and helps all business personnel develop a solid understanding of how to implement a hybrid approach that blends the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation2. Agile BM 201 - Mastering Agile Business ManagementThis course is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile/Scrum projects for anyone in a Product Owner role or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The Product Owner role in Agile is not well understood and many business managers who are assigned to perform that role are not well-prepared for it.3. Agile BM 301 - Enterprise-level Agile Business ManagementThe final course in this series is focused on advanced topics related to applying Agile to a business at an enterprise level includingAlignment and Value DisciplinesEnterprise-level frameworks (SAFe and DAD)Enterprise-level Agile TransformationsOrganizational Culture and Change Management____________________________________________________________________________Why Is This Curriculum Important?In a traditional, plan-driven project management environment,A large part of the management of a project can be delegated to a project manager, andOnce the business requirements for the project are documented and approved by the business, the business role in providing leadership and management of the project can be limited.In an Agile environment,The requirements and the design of the solution evolve and are further refined as the project progressesFor that reason, it is essential that the business is much more directly involved in providing leadership and direction to the project as it progressesIn order to provide effective leadership and direction to projects, the business people who are either directly or indirectly involved in Agile projects need to fully understand how the process works in order to participate collaboratively in the process with the project teams who are responsible for developing the solution.Many existing courses for business people in an Agile environment such as Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are limited to the ""mechanics"" of how to do Agile and are limited to a pure Agile approach.

608,1352388,Agile Business Analysis,"Business Analysts have a wide range of feelings about Agile.

Some love it. It’s a fast and nimble way to develop products, and you can be very productive in relatively little time.







Others hate it, because it is radically different from traditional control-oriented project approaches, and they struggle to understand their value and role when documentation takes a back seat.







And many others like the idea of Agile, but realize that it’s a tricky thing to get right – especially with very large organizations which have documentation and processes deeply engrained in their cultures.













If any of these statements sounds familiar, we designed this course for you.

  









There is a lot of training out there for agile teams, but agile BAs have very specific needs that haven’t been addressed… (until now)









That’s why we developed this course – to give you a basis on which to build an excellent BA career in any agile environment.

  









In this clear, concise, and easy-to-follow course, you will learn:

  









How to figure out what your role on the team needs to be

  What user stories and acceptance criteria really are – and it’s probably not what you think

  When to write requirements to maximize efficiency and minimize re-work

  Why the traditional product backlog is a mess and how to overcome it

  What a typical BA does in the course of a day, sprint, and release

  (and a whole lot more)

  









… all while learning the ropes from a seasoned expert and business analysis executive.

  









By the end of the course, you’ll have more than just knowledge… You’ll have the practice and practical experience you need to feel confident on the job.

613,3704956,Agile Kanban: Kanban for Software Development Teams,"Kanban is not a software development lifecycle methodology or an approach to project management.It requires that some process is already in place so that Kanban can be applied toincrementally change the underlying process.—David Anderson, KanbanKanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!This course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.We will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.We will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.Here is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:Introduction to Kanban  Kanban BoardFinding Inefficiencies in the ProcessLimiting Work in ProgressUnder utilization of ResourcesUnequal Sized TasksMarking the TasksOther Inefficiencies/IssuesKanban PracticesDefining DoneDaily Stand upSpecifying RulesKey Agile ConceptsUnderstanding  Creating User Stories, Theme  EpicWhat is Product BacklogDifference between Product Backlog  Product RoadmapAdvantages  Disadvantages of AgileHow Estimation is done in AgileWhy Relative Estimation in AgileT-Shirt  Fibonacci EstimationPlaning Poker in AgileUnderstanding  Creating Burn down Charts Minimum Viable ProductTeam VelocityThis course is ideal for software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.No prior experience is necessary to take this course. So, if even if you don’t know what Kanban is and the various principles and concepts under Kanban and Agile Project Management, not to worry.We will cover all of these concepts from scratch.Course enrollment grants you lifetime access to all the the entire course content including quizzes, practice exercises etc. In addition, you’ll also receive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up. And this all comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee! You have nothing to lose and so much knowledge to gain.I hope that you will enjoy the course, be challenged by it and learn a lot. The primary objective is to build a strong foundational knowledge of the principles of Kanban  Agile.It is suggested that you go through the course at a pace that makes sense for you. The topics build on each other, so it is better to slow down and really learn something than to just move on in order to keep up a certain pace. So, I have the tools needed to get the job done.

Many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project. Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions, develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about ""Agile versus Waterfall"".

That doesn't mean that traditional plan-driven project methodologies are obsolete and no longer useful; however, within a relatively short amount of time, a project manager who only knows how to use traditional plan-driven methodologies will be at a serious disadvantage in the job market.That's a big challenge for many project managers who have been schooled and indoctrinated in a plan-driven project management approach because Agile changes the very nature of how we do project management in many environments.

« Il n’y a rien de plus pratique qu’une bonne théorie », disait Kurt Lewin. Surtout quand cette théorie est le fait d’un praticien. Pendant plus de trente ans, Jacques Chaize s’est attaché avec succès à construire une entreprise agile, capable d’initier le changement plutôt que de le subir. Il s’est aussi attaché, à travers des livres et conférences, à formaliser, synthétiser, théoriser sans jargon ce qu’il fait et ce qui marche.
Dans un langage clair, il nous livre ici la quintessence de ce qui dans l’action permet à une entreprise de prendre en main son développement. Un témoignage exceptionnel dans le canevas de quelques règles de succès applicables.



À propos de l’auteur



Jacques Chaize





Jacques Chaize a consacré l’essentiel de sa carrière à diriger et développer des entreprises industrielles en France et dans le monde. Son expérience de dirigeant l’a conduit à mettre en place des organisations en réseau, à initier les premières démarches apprenantes et, plus récemment, à les conjuguer avec succès aux pratiques de lean management.
Président de Danfoss Water Controls depuis 1997 jusqu’à la cession réussie de l’entreprise à un groupe industriel coté en 2011, Jacques Chaize continue sa carrière d’entrepreneur indépendant.
Il a par ailleurs présidé le Centre des jeunes dirigeants (CJD) de 1988 à 1990, le Medef de Saône-et-Loire et de Bourgogne entre 1997 et 2003. Co-fondateur de l’association SOL-France pour le développement des organisations apprenantes, il a été Président de l’Association Progrès du Management (APM) de 2007 à 2010.
Jacques Chaize a décrit ses expériences dans plusieurs ouvrages : La Porte du changement s’ouvre de l’intérieur (Calmann Lévy, 1992) et Le Grand Ecart (Village Mondial, 1998). En 2007, il a coordonné Repenser l’Entreprise (Cherche Midi), un ouvrage collectif rassemblant des experts de toutes disciplines autour des enjeux de l’entreprise. En 2017, co-auteur de « The Lean Strategy » (McGrawHill-New York) à paraître en France début 2018.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/agile-lean-libere-les-cles-pour-transformer-votre-entreprise/,33,Agile & Scrum,15,14,albert académie,Aucun pré-requis,"Comment rendre votre entreprise agile

644,4231438,AI for Business - AI Applications for Business Success,"AI for Business – AI Applications for Business SuccessAI isn’t just a fancy concept that powers self-driving vehicles, robots, and high-tech companies.Most organizations – regardless of their size and industry – can benefit from the application of artificial intelligence.Charts and dashboards are useful tools, but they often struggle to analyze big and complex datasets. This is precisely when AI outperforms the traditional Business Intelligence approach! Correlation doesn’t imply causation, and this is a significant limitation of BI.Artificial Intelligence can help a company in a variety of ways – it can be employed to build customer retention models, increase gross revenue by optimizing your selling price, find a way to minimize costs and optimize business processes, and ultimately – to run an organization more effectively.This is what AI for Business course aims to teach you.Your instructor, Horia Margarit, has earned two Bachelor’s degrees in Cognitive and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master's degree in Statistics from Stanford University. With over 10 years of professional experience in the San Francisco Bay Area, he has differentiated himself by applying highly novel methods and approaches to tackling complex business problems. As a result, his predictions for business applications of AI have been featured in both CIO Magazine and Forbes. Horia’s primary focus is on technical underpinnings that maximize actual business and customer value.All this makes him uniquely qualified to teach this topic.In the course, you’ll get an overview of business analytics and find out how to define SMART goals and conduct SWOT analysis. You’ll go through the challenges and opportunities of supply chain analytics to then determine the business problem we’ll tackle throughout the course.Moreover, we will consider the key benefits and limitations of using business analytics approach to solving such problems.Having laid the foundations, we’ll then dig deeper and focus on attainability. Even more so, you will discover how to leverage the power of AI in order to achieve the set business goals.Here, you will be able to:· Build an AI model from high fidelity data· Extract actionable explanations· Predict the outcome· Evaluate the quality of the predictionsWe won’t spend too much time obtaining the data and building the AI model. Instead, we will focus on evaluating the performance of those methods.For that, you will go through key algorithms like Gradient Boosted Machines and Convergent Cross Mapping. Most of all, you will have the chance to examine in great detail novel approaches to understanding model performance such as LIME and SHAP values.And that’s not all!After we’ve learned how to obtain accurate predictions from our models, we’ll find out how we can show the significance of the obtained results. To do so, we’ll rely on parametric tests. More specifically, we will be working with the hybrid experiment and quantile difference tests.Take your AI career to new heights!This course is packed with valuable concepts and state-of-the-art techniques.Enroll now and start your journey to AI for business today!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ai-for-business-ai-applications-for-business-success/,135,Analytics,28,26,365 Careers,"You should have some rudimentary knowledge of higher level mathematics

This AJAX for beginner's tutorial course will teach you what AJAX is and how to start using it with PHP to create excellent web applications.

---------------------------------------------------------

Hands on project

On this course we will create a real AJAX application that will give you the skills you need to start implementing AJAX to your projects or start you on your web development journey.

----------------------------------------------------------

AJAX is all around us, just type something in the UDEMY search bar and you will automatically see words appear in the input; that's AJAX in action.

Do you need AJAX? I think the question should be, do you want your applications or websites to be awesome? Or course we do, right? YES.

I don't like to show off, but my students love me, and I love them, here are some of the reviews I get.

The Best Teacher ever  

Edwin Diaz i am a newbie and now i am writing php syntax :D awesome and your lectures and jokes are awesome. They help me to motivate and learn by doing :).

Groovy Goodness

If code is boring you to death or you wonder just what the buzz about Bootstrap, then hold on and take a ride with Edwin in this fun and very informative class. Clear, professional quality. I dare you not to smile after taking this class.

FANTASTIC!!

You're a very good teacher, you made it very simple and easy to understand, thank you so much, I want to learn more about bootstrap because the course was too short, but anyway great job. Sorry for my English, I'm Spanish. bye bye

Awesome

I really like listening to the instructor. He is easy to follow, and his lesson what to the point.



My Promise

I will do my best to teach you AJAX and to answer your questions promptly.

Your $$$$ invested in this course will be multiplied over and over again.

AJAX it's a super hot technology right now and having it in your toolbox will separate you from the rest of those developers out there that don't know it.

100% Money Back if you don't like it

Don't you love this? If for some reason you don't like the course within 30 days, Udemy will return your money and no hard feelings from me.

Are you still reading? What are you waiting for? Join now and learn AJAX the easy way.

The answer is simple: Ajax.  You’ve probably heard of it, but you’ve always wondered “What is Ajax”? Ajax is simply Asynchronous Javascript and XML. By taking our Ajax course, you can make pages on your web application respond quickly, and with a minimum of screen refreshes.With our Ajax course and a little Javascript knowledge you can use Ajax to take database information and store, alter, sort and conditionally format it all on the client side.  This minimizes the load on your server and makes your applications respond quickly and without reloading the HTML page.  Ajax communicates with the server behind the scenes while your user continues to use your web site, accessing the information they want. Our course will show you numerous Ajax examples and help you become proficient in using Ajax.In our Ajax course, master trainer Mark Lassoff takes you through the basics of Ajax right to advanced topics like parsing JSON responses from web services.  Our Ajax course is recommended for all web developers who want to improve their client side skills, and make professional, fast and responsive web applications.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/ajax-development/,178,Web Development,23,17,"Framework Tech Media

679,3395102,"Algorithmic Trading A-Z with Python, Machine Learning & AWS","Welcome to the most comprehensive Algorithmic Trading Course. It´s the first 100% Data-driven Trading Course!In this rigorous but yet practical Course, we will leave nothing to chance, hope, vagueness, or pure intuition! Did you know that 75% of retail Traders lose money with Day Trading? (some sources say 95%)For me as a Data Scientist and experienced Finance Professional this is not a surprise. Day Traders typically do not know/follow the five fundamental rules of (Day) Trading. This Course covers them all in detail!1. Know and understand the Day Trading BusinessDon´t start Trading if you are not familiar with terms like Bid-Ask Spread, Pips, Leverage, Margin Requirement, Half-Spread Costs, etc.Part 1 of this course is all about Day Trading A-Z with the Brokers Oanda and FXCM. It deeply explains the mechanics, terms, and rules of Day Trading (covering Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Baskets, and more).2. Use powerful and unique Trading StrategiesYou need to have a Trading Strategy. Intuition or gut feeling is not a successful strategy in the long run (at least in 99.9% of all cases). Relying on simple Technical Rules doesn´t work either because everyone uses them.You will learn how to develop more complex and unique Trading Strategies with Python. We will combine simple and also more complex Technical Indicators and we will also create Machine Learning- and Deep Learning- powered Strategies. The course covers all required coding skills (Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) from scratch in a very practical manner. 3. Test your Strategies before you invest real money (Backtesting / Forward Testing)Is your Trading Strategy profitable? You should rigorously test your strategy before 'going live'.This course is the most comprehensive and most rigorous Backtesting / Forward Testing course that you can find.You will learn how to apply Vectorized Backtesting techniques, Iterative Backtesting techniques (event-driven), live Testing with play money, and more. And I will explain the difference between Backtesting and Forward Testing and show you what to use when. The backtesting techniques and frameworks covered in the course can be applied to long-term investment strategies as well! 4. Take into account Trading Costs - it´s all about Trading Costs!""Trading with zero commissions? Great!"" ... Well, there is still the Bid-Ask-Spread and even if 2 Pips seem to be very low, it isn´t! The course demonstrates that finding profitable Trading Strategies before Trading Costs is simple. It´s way more challenging to find profitable Strategies after Trading Costs! Learn how to include Trading Costs into your Strategy and into Strategy Backtesting / Forward Testing. And most important: Learn how you can control and reduce Trading Costs. 5. Automate your TradesManual Trading is error-prone, time-consuming, and leaves room for emotional decision-making. This course teaches how to implement and automate your Trading Strategies with Python, powerful Broker APIs and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Create your own Trading Bot and fully automate/schedule your trading sessions in the AWS Cloud! Finally... this is more than just a course on automated Day Trading:the techniques and frameworks covered can be applied to long-term investing as well.it´s an in-depth Python Course that goes beyond what you can typically see in other courses. Create Software with Python and run it in real-time on a virtual Server (AWS)!we will feed Machine Learning  Deep Learning Algorithms with real-time data and take ML/DL-based actions in real-time!

684,2028392,Algorithms and Data Structures in C#: Complete Tutorial,"Whylearn about data structures and algorithms? Algorithms and data structures constitute the fundamentals of programming.Good understanding of algorithms and data structures is one of the most important requirements for a great number of work positions. You'll have to solve many problems related to algorithms and data structures at coding interviews. Indeed, you can live without an understanding of algorithms and data structures, in general. However, you can do that until you face a real problem which requires to choose right data structures and implement custom algorithms. If you haven't ever faced such problems, believe me, this is just a matter of time. One day, you'll face such a problem and if you don't understand algorithms and data structures in depth, you'll feel yourself ashamed and helpless. You'll be stuck.If you're not good at algorithms and data structures, you'll never pass a coding interview in a decent company. Almost all the companies prefer to hire those developers who have good understanding of algorithms and data structures, remember that. Do not delay the study of fundamental concepts.Better hardware is not a solution for all the performance-related problems. Sometimes, you need to write software for very slow devices. And that very often depends on the budget of a customer, by the way, so you don't have a control over it.You'd better to understand what's going on under the hood at least one level in-depth. Indeed, if you don't understand how List works, sometimes you'll make sub-optimal or completely wrong decisions.Why this course?You may ask me ""why should I take exactly your course?"" And here is my answer:This course is a comprehensive tutorial which covers a great number of topicsI tried to do my best to make this course not dryThis course concentrates not only at algorithms and data structures in general but it uncovers the internals of data structures and algorithms built-in .NET BCL (.NET Core's BCL is the same regarding fundamental data structures and algorithms)This course is practical with exercises and solutionsThis course will definitely help you to pass technical interviewsThis course is made by a professional software developer with more than 10 years of real-world experienceand many other reasons :)What's in the Course?For now, the course covers:Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures: what is a data structure, abstract data type and what's the difference between these notions. What is an algorithm and why they are important to us?Introduction to Algorithm Analysis: determine how long will a program work, build a log-log plot, approximations, order of growth (Big-O notation), memory consumptionArrays: arrays in C#, arrays in memory, time complexity of operations on arraysSort Algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, recursion, shell sort, merge sort, quick sort, stability of sort algorithmsLists: List built-in .NETBCL, nodes, linked list including singly and doubly linked lists, linked list built-in .NETStacks: theory and practice; stack based on array, stack based on a linked list, stack built-in .NETQueues: theory and practice; queue based on array, circular queue, queue based on linked list, queue built-in .NET BCLSearch Algorithms: linear search, binary search (more will be added in the future)Symbol Tables: intro, API, sequential search-based, binary search-basedHash Tables: intro, hash functions, GetHashCode, approaches to collisions resolving: separate chaining and linear probing, Dictionary built-in BCL, Sets in BCLTrees: binary search tree (BST), implementing BST (more will be added in the future)Heaps: intro, heaps and arrays, implementation, Heap Sort (more will be added in the future, specifically about Priority Queues)Immutable Collections: immutability and memory pressure, immutable stacks and queues, immutable list, immutable sets, immutable dictionaries, builders in immutable collectionsDifferent Algorithms.

E através desses operadores nós manipularemos os dados para conseguir os resultados desejados.Alguns outros conceitos importantes que também aprenderemos neste curso:Os conceitos de linguagem fraca e fortemente tipada, que é a definição da mutabilidade dos tipos dos dados;Estruturas de controle de fluxo de código, que aplicam as restrições condicionais, ou seja, executam partes do código se certas condições forem cumpridas (if/else);Estruturas de repetição, que são aquelas que dadas as condições, repetem o mesmo trecho de código por determinadas vezes (while/for);E também o fluxo de código, que em cima disso, aprenderemos a corrigir os erros ou bugs que possam aparecer.Desbravaremos o mundo das funções que são blocos de código nomeados e que a partir desse nome podem ser chamados em qualquer lugar do algoritmo. As funções representam ferramentas poderosíssimas para transformar dados. Estudaremos vários tipos de funções partindo de suas anatomias e atingindo todas suas possibilidades e funcionalidades.Vale ressaltar que nosso curso está repleto de exercícios e desafios para a fixação do conhecimento.

Um exemplo clássico é a resolução do problema de choque de horários de professores em uma escola, no qual existem diversas combinações de horários e aulas e o objetivo é construir a grade de horário dinamicamente de acordo com a quantidade de aulas e a disponibilidade de cada professor. Outros exemplos são: empresas de telecomunicações podem projetar novas redes óticas, transportadoras podem planejar melhor a rota de entrega de mercadorias, investidores podem escolher os melhores investimentos; dentre várias outras.

Baseado nisso, neste curso você vai aprender na teoria e principalmente na prática como desenvolver do zero um algoritmo genético aplicado em um cenário real de uma transportadora. Neste contexto, nós seremos consultores de uma empresa de transporte que possui vários produtos a serem transportados, porém, a empresa possui somente um caminhão disponível e com espaço limitado de armazenamento. Nosso objetivo será desenvolver um algoritmo que consiga gerar a melhor combinação dos produtos que devem ser transportados, levando em consideração o fato de que a transportadora quer ganhar o máximo de dinheiro possível com o frete e ocupando o espaço disponível no caminhão.

Esse tipo de algoritmo é baseado em encontrar soluções cada vez melhores a partir da evolução das gerações anteriores, sendo fundamentado nos processos naturais de evolução. E para chegar em nosso objetivo, você vai aprender os principais conceitos sobre essa técnica de inteligência artificial, tais como: população, indivíduo, crossover/reprodução e mutação. Ao final do curso, você terá um algoritmo genético completo que conseguirá resolver o problema da transportadora, o qual pode ser aplicado para outros cenários comerciais. Utilizaremos a linguagem R para a programação das funções e desenvolveremos tudo passo a passo e com muitos detalhes, para que você tenha uma visão bem clara e didática de como esses algoritmos conseguem resolver problemas reais do cotidiano. Além disso, teremos um bônus no qual você vai aprender como criar uma tabela de produtos no MySql e aplicar nosso algoritmo utilizando os dados de uma base de dados, o que pode facilitar a adaptação do código para utilização em ambientes comerciais. Por fim, este material pode ser considerado de nível iniciante para quem está entrando tanto na área de Inteligência Artificial quanto na área de algoritmos genéticos. Porém, caso você seja de nível mais avançado, este curso poderá servir como uma ótima fonte de consulta e revisão dos conceitos.

Neste curso você terá uma visão teórica e prática sobre essa área, aplicando todos os conceitos em um projeto prático que terá como objetivo aplicar os algoritmos para encontrar a menor rota entre duas cidades. Utilizaremos duas abordagens: a busca sem informação e a busca com informação. A primeira não apresenta inteligência e é composta pelos algoritmos de busca em largura e profundidade, enquanto que a segunda abordagem será implementada por meio dos algoritmos de busca gulosa e busca A* (A Estrela). Esse último algoritmo é muito utilizado em jogos e foi ele que deu origem à tecnologia de GPS (Global Position System) que muito utilizamos em nosso dia a dia!

704,82778,All about NodeJS,"About this Course



NodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript. But wait ! Isn't Javascript meant to be used for forms and stuff on web pages ?  





  	                          Well that was 10 years ago. The world has gone from 'Oops! You've not filled up the form properly !' days to today's modern web apps and social media sites that rely heavily on Javascript. Google Apps, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn, being handful examples of this movement. And to think that this quantum leap would not have been possible without Javascript is not an overstatement. Today, when you socialize with your friends on Facebook, or use your Gmail inbox, you're running thousands of lines of code written in Javascript, in your browser.  





  	                          With Node JS, you can take this knowledge back on the server, where usually you would expect to see the likes of PHP, Ruby, ASP dot NET etc. But that's only a small portion of the reason why NodeJS is so cool. The fact that you can write full blown networked applications (think chat servers, collaborative tools, real-time data visualisation apps) with just a few lines of code is more than reason enough to not only look at NodeJS, but deep dive into it !  





  	                          But I know PHP ? Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :  





  	Node allows you to write highly scalable networked apps deployed on the cloud !  	You're working at a different level of application design per se with Node and that means that you're not writing an app that sits on top of a stack, you design the stack from the server up. And while that may sound daunting, it really is not and you'll see why.  	You code in the same language, both on the server and on the front end ! We're all polyglots (we use multiple programming languages and syntax in most of our projects), but managing code in the same language on the back-end and the front-end never hurts and in-fact can be a huge time saver when debugging.  	NodeJS is used by the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo and Microsoft to name a few. Its pretty new and consequently you gain advantage from the exponentially growing community of NodeJS  Javascript developers and that's great fun, really !  	If you've been coding in Javascript, you can leverage your existing knowledge and skills and take it to a whole new level !  











  	            The Real Problem





So, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you're here.





  	                      In this course, we'll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !  





  	            Project Oriented Learning    





  	                          With NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.  





  	            A. ChatCAT - One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !  





  	                      You will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development  production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying  Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku  Digital Ocean's Cloud Services and lots more...  





  	      B. PhotoGRID - The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.  





  	                      You will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS  AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing  Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying  Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon's Elastic IP Service  Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...  





  	                          In the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.  





  	                      And I'm always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.





  	      BONUS :: Here's the best thing about this course. The curriculum that you see gets you up and running with NodeJS  Cloud Deployment. However, there is so much more that you can do with NodeJS, which is why I will keep adding new lectures and sections to this course on an ongoing basis. There is so much more that you will get with full lifetime access to lectures and all updates !!

758,580110,An Introduction to Emotional Intelligence,"What is it to be the best human being that you can be?Emotional intelligence is an aspect of you as a whole person affecting your work life and your personal life.Your emotional intelligence is your ability to combine your thinking with your feelings in order to build good quality relationships and to make good authentic decisions. It is managing who you are in the moment to meet your emotional needs through conscious choice and is fundamental to leading a full, rich and rewarding life.Emotional intelligence is different from IQ - cognitive intelligence, and offers a different perspective on success and performance at work. There are many parts to emotional intelligence - itpredicts effectiveness and can bechangedand developed.Research suggests that emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence (IQ) are unconnected: you can have a high level of emotional intelligence but a low level of cognitive intelligence, and vice versa.Your emotional intelligence is your responsibility! How you react and respond to events is governed by your emotional intelligence. You can work to develop your emotional intelligence, but this is not easy.This course explores what emotional intelligence in the workplace by investigating what it is and what it is not. It covers the main models of emotional intelligence and what they mean but more importantly how they can be practically applied at work.The course resolves any confusion you may have around some of the terminology used in various emotional intelligence courses, such as what is the difference between EI and EQ? You'll get to understand why EI is a broader term that covers emotional intelligence in much more depth. People often talk about positive and negative emotions. This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way. The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace. The course investigates the advantages and disadvantages of emotional intelligence, ways it can be improved and some do's and don'ts of working with emotional intelligence in the workplace.It will test your emotional intelligence!Changing the way that you work with your emotions and working with your emotional intelligence is not easy. This course will give you some insights BUT developing your emotional intelligence will take you time and a lot of effort, and even then you are not going to get it right all the time!! Emotional intelligence is about improving performance, engagement and well being in a sustainable way, so that it sticks.By completing this course, you will be able toIdentify what emotional intelligence is and what it is notExplain what emotional intelligence is and why it is importantExplain the difference between Emotional Quotient (EQ) and Emotional Intelligence (EI)Describe how emotional intelligence differences from other intelligencesRecognise how and why emotions are importantList some emotional intelligence competencies that can be developedThe course contains narrated videos, quizzes and some fun material to download - including a series of complementary crib cards. The course contains some insights fromone of the key researchers in the field of emotional intelligence -Dr. David CarusofromYale University Center for Emotional Intelligence. He shares his views on the subject and some insights into emotional intelligence as an ability.The course material makes up part of a one day workshop endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management. It is equivalent to about 8 hour's CPD training.PLEASENOTE-This course isNOTfor you if you are not prepared to work through thepractical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course. Emotional intelligence cannot be developed by learning some techniques throughwatching a few video lectures.The courserequires you to do some reflective thinking, toget some feedback and to discuss your development with others. I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.This course is beingcontinually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.There are THREEpractical activities included within the course that are designed to help you to develop your emotional intelligence. 1. Reflecting About This Course 2. Assessing your Emotional Intelligence3. Three Good ThingsThese activities involve some interactionwith other people and some reflection outside of the course. They are designed to help you find out how you are using your emotional intelligence in the workplace, how you view your emotional intelligence and how others view your emotional intelligence.  You will be guided on what and how you need to change. The emotional brain learns from doing things and through activity. Repetition and rehearsal over weeks will embed in changes.The course is featured in the Udemy forBusiness catalogue. A few people are instructed to take the course under duress by their organisation. The course has recently been given 2 star ratings from a number of learners without comments for some reason - not the behaviour expected of people with emotional intelligence! I am not sure why this is. I have thanked each person and asked for some feedback but have had no response and so I am unable to address any issues within the course.

This is the first course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the coveted Google Certified Data Engineer.At this juncture the Google Certified Data Engineer is theonly real world certification for data and machine learning engineers.  The Harvard Review dubbed the data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. It might be the greatest job in the world if you have a dedicated team of data engineers at your beckon call otherwise you’re first week of work is going to be a tough one.  Most applied machine learning is supervised. That simply means you use a data set to build your machine learning or deep learning models with.  In the real world data is messy, complicated and very difficult to work with. Another real world issues is working with data at scale. Very few companies have the compute or storage resources to work with large data sets. That's where the Google Cloud Platform comes in. The tools they've built for the cloud are the tools they are using internally.This is the first course in a series of course dedicated to learning the Google Cloud Platform and attaining the Google Certified Data Engineer.  This course will lay the foundation for what you’ll need in order to become a data engineer and pass the exam. In the course we will cover all the basics of the platform and be prepared to move into the more advanced data engineering specific courses. Please keep in mind this course alone will not give you the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. The course will lay the foundation for what you'll need to know before you begin a more intensive study of the services specific to data on the Google Cloud Platform.                               **Five Reasons to Take this Course**1) Google is the World Leader in Machine LearningGoogle knows data and they know big data. They workwith some of the largestdata sets in the world. They also have one of the largest data science teams on the planet. Companies that know data science know data engineering. Google has been on the forefront of data exploration for years.2) Occam's Razor Approach to TeachingLess is almost always more. If you're serious about data engineeringas a career you don't need or want your hand held for long periods of time.You want the core of any subject and then you want to get your hands dirty. My courses are relatively short and to the point. You don't have time for filler and Idon't believe in adding it.3) Real World Instructor Experience
I've been working with data for over two decades. I've authored books,created applications being used in the real world and have over 30 course on Udemy specific to data. I've worked with over 50 different companies as an employee or consultant. Data has been my life for two decades and all of that has been in the real world.4) The Only Data Engineering Certification on the MarketI have to be honest with you. I'm not a huge fan of most mastorial programs for machine learning or data related degrees. There is still quite a gap between what colleges teach and what companies expect. I believe certifications offer a better path into the real world of data and machine learning. A master's degree might get you the interview but hands on with the product and the certification will get you the job.5) Limited Data Engineering CoursesAt the time I authored this course there are no other courses on the market that are dedicated to learning the skills you'll need for passing the Google certified data engineer exam. My courses aren't specific to learning how to pass the exam. I want you to be able to pass the exam but more importantly I want you to be able to apply what you've learned in my courses in order to work with various real world data sets.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/an-introduction-to-google-cloud-platform-for-data-engineers/,182,Cloud Development Big Data,55,44,Mike West,"You'll need a basic understanding of cloud technologies.

This course is part of my series for data engineering. The course is a prerequisite for my course titled Tensorflow on the Google Cloud Platform for DataEngineers.This course will show you the basics of machine learning for data engineers. The course is geared towards answering questions for the Google Certified Data Engineering exam. This is NOT a general course or introduction to machine learning. This is a very focused course for learning the concepts you'll need to know to pass the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam.At this juncture, theGoogle Certified Data Engineeris the onlyreal world certificationfor data and machine learning engineers. Machine learningis a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The key part of that definition is “without being explicitly programmed.” The vast majority of applied machine learning is supervised machine learning. The word applied means you build models in the real world. Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that involves building models from data that exists. A good way to think about supervised machine learning is:If you can get your data into a tabular format, like that of an excel spreadsheet, then most machine learning models can model it. In the course, we’ll learn the different types of algorithms used. We will also cover the nomenclature specific to machine learning. Every discipline has their own vernacular and data science is not different.  You’ll also learn why the Python programming language has emerged as the gold standard for building real world machine learning models. Additionally, we will write a simple neural network and walk through the process and the code step by step. Understanding the code won't be as important as understanding the importance and effectiveness of one simple artificial neuron.                               *Five Reasons to take this Course.*

They've been a decade ahead of everyone. Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google.

 3)The Growth of Data is Insane

 Ninety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.

 4) Machine Learning in Plain English

 Machine learning is one of the hottest careers on the planet and understanding the basics is required to attaining a job as a data engineer. Google expects data engineers to be able to build machine learning models. In this course, we will cover all the basics of machine learning at a very high level. 

 5) You want to be ahead of the Curve

 The data engineer role is fairly new. While you’re learning, building your skills andbecoming certified you arealso the first to be part of this burgeoning field. You know that the first to be certified meansthe first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.

Varias preguntas facilitan enfocar el análisis financiero. Una serie de preguntas está orientada al futuro. Por ejemplo, ¿cuenta una compañía con los recursos para ser exitosa y crecer? ¿Cuenta con recursos para invertir en nuevos proyectos? ¿Cuáles son sus fuentes de rentabilidad? ¿Cuál es su capacidad futura de producir utilidades? Una segunda serie incluye preguntas que evalúan el récord del de- sempeño de una compañía y su capacidad para alcanzar el desempeño financiero esperado. Por ejemplo, ¿qué tan firme es la posición financiera de la compañía? ¿Qué tan rentable es la compañía? ¿Cumplieron las utilidades con los pronósticos del analista? Esto incluye un análisis de las razones por las que una compañía no estuvo a la altura de las expectativas (o las superó).El análisis financiero se compone de tres áreas amplias: análisis de la rentabilidad, análisis de riesgos y análisis de las fuentes y la utilización de fondos. El análisis de la rentabilidad es la evaluación del rendimiento sobre la inversión de una compañía. Se enfoca en las fuentes y los niveles de rentabilidad, e implica la identificación y la medición del impacto de varios generadores de rentabilidad. También incluye la evaluación de las dos fuentes principales de rentabilidad: már- genes (la porción de las ventas no compensada por los costos) y rotación (utilización del capital). El análisis de la rentabilidad también se centra en las razones de cambio en la rentabilidad y en la sustentabilidad de las utilidades.Análisis de estados financieros comparativosLos analistas realizan un análisis de los estados financieros comparativos revisando los balances y las declaraciones de ingresos, consecutivos de un periodo a otro. Esto por lo común implica una revisión de los cambios en las cuentas de los balances individuales en un intervalo de uno o varios años. La información más importante que a menudo revela el análisis de estados financieros comparativos es la tendencia. Una comparación de los estados a lo largo de varios periodos indica la dirección, la velocidad y el alcance de una tendencia. El análisis comparativo también compara las tendencias en partidas relacionadas.Análisis de razones financierasEl análisis de razones financieras se encuentra entre las herramientas más populares y más ampliamente utilizadas del análisis financiero. Una razón expresa una relación matemática entre dos cantidades. Aun cuando el cálculo de una razón es simplemente una operación aritmética, su interpretación es más compleja.

Dans ce cours, vous allez réaliser des applications Android nouvelle génération avec les dernières techniques de programmation proposées par Google.Mon objectif est qu’à la fin de la formation, vous soyez équipés pour développer des applications Android robustes et maintenables. Vous allez le voir, la structure de votre code Android va changer après avoir regardé ces vidéos !Le cours s’articule autour des Architecture Components, un ensemble de bibliothèques publié par Google. Chaque composant va modifier une partie de votre appli pour qu’elle soit prête à évoluer sans que vous commenciez à transpirer en pensant à tout ce qu’il va falloir casser pour y arriver.Les Architecture Components sont utilisés par de grandes entreprises comme Samsung, AirBnB ou HP. Ces bibliothèques sont déjà présentes dans 72% des 500 applications les plus utilisées sur le Play Store (statistiques du site appbrain).Une section est dédiée à chaque Architecture Component. Pour chaque composant, nous étudierons sa structure et son utilisation, avant de faire un exercice pratique. Nous finirons par un projet d’application complète : le projet BookStore. Les Architecture ComponentsLes Architecture Components sont à voir comme des legos : vous pouvez les utiliser indépendamment ou les combiner. Ils fonctionnent très bien ensemble, mais libre à vous de n'utiliser que les composants qui sont utiles à votre projet !Voici la liste complète des Architecture Components que nous aborderons ensemble :Lifecycle : simplifier la gestion du cycle de vie des Activity et des Fragments ;LiveData : rendre vos données observables pour réagir à la moindre modification ;ViewModel : structurez autrement vos Activity et modulariser vos applications ;Room : réduisez votre code base de données sans sacrifier la moindre fonctionnalité ;WorkManager : programmez facilement des tâches en background.Les cas pratiquesChaque exercice se rapproche d’un cas pratique que vous pouvez rencontrer dans votre application :Un LocationListener abonné au Lifecycle : vous pourrez le déplacer dans une Activity  ou un Fragment avec un minimum de code ;Surveiller la connectivité réseau avec un LiveData : soyez notifié des changements d’état avec une API plus naturelle et sans risque de crash ;Un écran de Login utilisateur avec un ViewModel : gérez les états de succès / échecs avec le modèle MVVM pour améliorer votre code ;Stockage de favoris en base de données avec Room : supprimez 90% du code base de données tout en conservant les mêmes fonctionnalités ;Séquence de tâches en background parallélisée avec WorkManager : simplifiez la gestion de vos tâches et des contraintes.Le projet BookStoreAprès avoir approfondi chaque Architecture Component, nous les réunirons tous dans une application d’exemple de bibliothèque de livres : le projet BookStore. Cette appli stocke ses données en base de données locale et simule une synchronisation serveur en background.Un dernier motCe cours se base sur ce que j’ai appris après avoir pratiqué des milliers d’heures sur Android.

Dans ce cours, vous allez apprendre à utiliser le langage Kotlin pour développer vos applications Android. Que vous soyez débutant complet en programmation ou que vous êtes déjà intermédiaire, ce cours vous apprendra à réaliser des applications mobiles.Pourquoi faire des applications Android en Kotlin ?Google a annoncé en 2017 le support officiel de Kotlin sur Android. Java n’est plus le seul langage sur cette plateforme, vous pouvez maintenant écrire vos applications en utilisant Kotlin à 100% !A la fin de ce cours, vous serez capable d’écrire des applications Android complexes, avec le support de l’affichage téléphone / tablette, le stockage de vos informations en base de données et des requêtes HTTP pour rendre votre application connectée.Si vous avez envie de devenir un développeur mobile, Android est aujourd’hui l’OS le plus répandu sur les téléphones des utilisateurs. Il représente 85% de tout le marché. Si vous avez une idée d’application en tête, il y a 9 chances sur 10 pour que vos utilisateurs soient sur Android.Structure du coursJe pense que pour apprendre et maîtriser une nouvelle compétence, il faut la pratiquer. C’est pour cela que nous allons réaliser ensemble 2 projets d’applications complètes (Notes et Météo) avec toutes les explications théoriques qui vont autour.Dans cette optique, j’ai structuré le cours de la manière suivante :Section(s) consacrée au langage Kotlin ;Section(s) consacrée à Android ;Projet d’application qui intègre toutes les notions précédemment abordées.Nous allons répéter ce schéma, en augmentant progressivement la difficulté.Projets d’applicationsLes 2 projets que nous réaliserons sont de difficulté croissante, le premier étant l’application Note qui a les fonctionnalité suivantes :Afficher de notes dans une liste dynamique ;Éditer des notes dans un écran dédié ;Stocker les notes en fichier pour avoir de la persistance.L’application suivante, Météo, est plus complexe car elle intègre plus de fonctionnalités :Récupérer des données météos depuis Internet avec le service OpenWeatherMap ;Supporter l’affichage sur téléphone et tablette ;Stocker les informations de villes en base de données.KotlinPour développer ces projets, nous devons apprendre à programmer en Kotlin ! Voici les grands thèmes que nous allons aborder pour découvrir le langage :Les types de variables et les déclarations ;Le contrôle de flux : if / else, for, while ;Définir et appeler des fonctions ;Créer des classes avec de l’héritage, des interfaces et des génériques.Une fois que les bases auront été posées, nous passerons à des notions plus avancées comme :Le late init et le lazy init ;Les Data Class, Sealed Class, Enum Class ;Les high order functions et les lambdas ;Les fonctions d’extensions personnalisées et proposée par Kotlin (let, apply, use, etc.).AndroidUne fois que le langage est maîtrisé, nous basculons sur Android, à la découverte complète de cet OS :Définition d’un écran avec une Activity et un Layout ;Communication d’informations entre les écrans avec un Intent ;Afficher des listes d’éléments ;Afficher des Dialogs.Après cela, on passe à la vitesse supérieur avec des fonctionnalités qui se trouveront dans la majorité de vos applications :Supporter l’affichage multi-device (téléphone / tablette) avec les Fragments ;Stocker des informations en base de données SQLite ;Faire des requêtes réseau avec la bibliothèque Retrofit ;Gérer les permissions de l’applications.BonusParce-qu'il n’y a pas que le code qui compte pour développer une application, nous allons également regarder des sujets qui sont autour du code :Installation de l’environnement de développement sur Windows, macOS, Linux ;Tour des fonctionnalités d’Android Studio pour se familiariser avec l’interface ;Comment débugger une application pour détecter les erreurs ;Explication de la procédure à suivre pour déployer votre application sur le Google Play StoreUn dernier motJ’ai créé ce cours avec l’envie de partager ma passion pour le langage Kotlin et vous montrer à quel point cette nouvelle technologie fonctionne bien avec Android.

792,1424326,Android App Development Masterclass using Kotlin,"What do you get in this course?In this course, you will discover the power of Android app development, and obtain the skills to dramatically increase your career prospects as a software developer. You’ll also have a head start over other developers using obsolete tools and earlier versions of Android.Android is continually being updated and you'll learn how to target but users of current versions of Android and older versions as well.With this course, you get the best of both worlds. You’re taught to write code for Android that works with the current version and older versions of Android by using the AppCompat library. That way, the apps you build will work with more versions of Android, giving you access to a wider audience of users.Starting is easy because no previous programming experience is needed. NONE! If you do have it, great. Or maybe you just want to brush up on your Android development skills, and that’s fantastic too.The course is presented using a combination of video, slides and diagrams, all designed to teach you everything you need to know.Here is what just one student thinks about the course.""If you are thinking of learning how to develop an Android app, you should be doing this course. It is comprehensive and covers so many aspects of programming an Android app. The best part is that Tim explains and teaches you how to become an independent developer.    Since completing this course, I have gone on and developed my own application, which is now published on the Google Play Store! Developing an app takes patience, and it is definitely worthwhile going through all the content in this course."" - Daniel LeeShould you write Android apps that target only the very latest version of Android?If you have an iPhone or iPad, chances are high that you update each year to the latest iOS release - most users do.The situation is completely different with Android. Only a relatively small percentage of Android users update their phones annually.If you write your apps to only support the latest version of Android, you will ensure 95% of your potential user base will never see your app.  The Google app store will only show apps that a users Android device can run, so if their device is not running the latest version of Android, they won't even be able to find your app on the Google play app store!How do you make sure your app targets older versions of Android?Android development is less about making sure you are creating apps that work with the latest version of Android, and more about ensuring your apps work with whatever versions of Android your users are running.Google are aware of this problem and have something call the AppCompat library.  Which is a way for you to ensure your apps work on older devices.This is not enabled by default.  Meaning that if you do not specifically configure your app to use this library and target older devices and newer ones, it either won't show up at all for users searching for your app, or older Android devices running your app might crash because they are trying to access features that do not exist in their version of Android.The key is to use this library.  And that's what you will learn in this course.Does that mean that your apps can only use features from really old Android versions?No it does not.  The AppCompat library is constantly updated by Google.  They go back and add features to the library which allows older Android devices to access newer features of Android.But again, this is not turned on by default.  You have to create and write your Android apps in a particular way to have your Android app be able to work correctly for current and older versions of Android.Should you learn Kotlin?Now that Google are pushing so hard for Android developers to use Kotlin, we are seeing a dramatic shift to Kotlin - It's similar to the iOS situation a few years ago with Objective-C when Apple released Swift.Fast forward a few years and everyone is using Swift.  This is starting to happen with Android app development. Developers who used to use  Java are switching to Kotlin.  You can see why Google want this to happen.  They have been in court numerous times with Oracle (the owners of Java) relating to a dispute over the use of the Java language.Google want developers to adopt Kotlin so that they don't have to worry about Java any more.The recent Google I/O conference show mainly Kotlin code examples.  You can see where we are heading.  Kotlin is the future for Android app development.Soon there will be few Java developers writing Android apps - they will be using Kotlin.The good news is, we've bundled a complete Kotlin tutorial we wrote from scratch with the course.  So not only do we use Kotlin in this course (teaching best practices along the way), but we also include a complete Kotlin tutorial as well. You will learn how to use the Kotlin language in this course.This is what you’ll learn in the course:·      Develop apps for the very latest version of Android that also work on older Android devices running older versions of the Android operating system.·      Download, install and configure the necessary (free) software.·      Create your first app.·      Build a range of apps demonstrating key aspects of the Android framework.·      Test your apps on emulators or a real Android phone or tablet.·      You’ll learn Kotlin programming because Google are recommending and pushing adoption of Kotlin for Android app development.  Included are Kotlin tutorial videos that will get you up to speed fast.·      Ensure your apps work with current and older Android versions on phones and tablets.·      Use Android studio 3.2, the newest version of Google's premier Android tool.·      Learn how to use databases, web services, and even get your apps to speak!·      Understand the all new Constraint layout, for ""drag and drop"" screen creation.·      Use powerful libraries of code to play videos, download website data, manipulate images, and a whole lot more!To reinforce what you’ve learnt during the course, there are numerous challenges designed to help you understand each concept being taught. You’re also shown the solution to the challenge so you know you’re always on the right track.The course is continually updated and enhanced, and fully supported as it evolves. With many courses, it’s just set and forget. But not with this one! We’ve got a PROVEN track record of continually updating and adding new content. An example is Tim's Java Masterclass course which now has 77 hours of content and counting, and benefited a whopping 260,000 students.And if you have any doubts about the course, be blown away by the glowing reviews left by students on this page.What else will you learn?You will  learn how Android works at a deep level. Many courses show you how to create Android apps, allowing you to follow along clicking buttons but not really understanding what it happening.To become a successful Android app developer, you need to understand why you are clicking that button, and how the Android operating system works and how the Android SDK and Framework works.If you truly understand how something works, it means you can produce better quality apps, that have fewer bugs.We don't promise that you are going to write a Facebook or Instagram clone app in this course - Courses that say they are going to teach you to create apps like that show apps with only the smallest amount of functionality, and usually don't explain anything in detail.  There is no point going through Android training unless you can take that training and apply it into your own apps.This course is designed for you to follow along, but then to apply the information you have learned into your own apps.Your instructors are me, Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul Roberts. Between them theyhave a collective 70 years of commercial software development experience, meaning you’re learning the right way to program to maximize your future development potential.Here’s what’s important. There’re a lot of people teaching Android development who are not developers. We’re developers with many years’ experience with the Android platform, who also teach Android.Importantly, our courses teach students the real-life skills needed to get those in-demand jobs or further your programming skills.Take this course in confidence today knowing you have just found the BEST Android Kotlin course on Udemy!  Don't delay.

794,1803806,Android Architecture Masterclass,"In this course, you'll deep dive into Android design and architecture and learn how to write clean, readable and maintainable code in your Android applications.As you probably know, starting developing for Android isn't that hard. Really, you can go from zero to publishing an app on Google Play in just few months. However, it's even easier to mess up your Android project with dirty code. The symptoms of dirty code are all too common: classes with thousands of lines of code, duplicated code all over the place, obscure naming, random structure of packages, Singletons, etc. All these are very serious problems which, sooner or later, appear in and slow down most Android projects.However, it doesn't have to be like that! There are best practices which you can learn and use in your Android applications that will ensure their long-term quality: Clean ArchitectureModel-View-X architectural patternsDependency InjectionPackage by FeatureLogic Reuse Through Composition and InheritanceMany more...After completing this course, you'll start writing clean and readable code. Different features will be encapsulated in small, decoupled classes which will be organized into meaningful packages to reflect your application's business domain.

803,919872,Android Java Masterclass - Become an App Developer,"There’s no getting around it.











Android accounts for 81.7% of all smartphones sold, but not all come packed with the very latest Android Nougat.

  

















































That won’t worry you because after completing this course, the apps you build will perform brilliantly on Android Nougat or any older Android operating system.

  

















































Now that’s something most courses don’t teach you!

  



























































So, you want to be an Android 7 Nougat programmer?  Or you are interested in Android 8 Oreo?

















































Well, I’m Tim Buchalka, one of your instructors, and I’ve designed the Android 7 Nougat App and Android 8 Orea Masterclass just for you!  Yes one, course covering both version!

















































Choosing a course that’s perfect for you can be damn hard. You need Instructors:

  







































·      Who are passionate about what they do.

  







































·      Keep their courses continually updated.

  







































·      And most important, provide outstanding support and follow up to your questions.

  

















































That’s what I do. And that’s the reason why I made it into the Top 10 List of Outstanding Instructors in the 2015 Udemy Instructor Awards.

  

















































Know that you’re exactly in the right place to MASTER Android 7 Nougat app programming as well as Android 8 Oreo!























Yes, we are in the process right now of updating the entire course to Android Oreo now it has been released by Google!

















































In this course, you will discover the power of Android app development, and obtain the skills to dramatically increase your career prospects as a software developer. You’ll also have a head start over other developers using obsolete tools and earlier versions of Android.

  

















































Android is continually being updated, so OLD versions of the operating systems will have features from the latest version. It's called AppCompat, which is a set of support libraries used to make apps developed with newer versions, work with older versions.

  

















































But it only works if the developer codes it a right way. It doesn’t just happen by default. The way I teach you in this Masterclass course is the right way!

  

















































With my course, you get the best of both worlds. You’re taught to write code for the latest version of Android Nougat with a strong focus on AppCompat. That way, the apps you build will also support older versions of Android.

  

















































Most Android courses just focus on teaching app development for the current Nougat version. What that means is you’re only taught to make apps for the latest version of Android, and that alienates a huge user base.

  

















































With my course, that’s not the case. Your skill level is maximized so your app reaches more users, which means more downloads, which means more money.

  

















































Starting is easy because no previous programming experience is needed. NONE! If you do have it, great. Or maybe you just want to brush up on your Android development skills, and that’s fantastic too.

  

















































The course is presented using a combination of video, slides and diagrams, all designed to teach you everything you need to know.

  

















































This is what you’ll learn in the course:

  

















































·      Develop apps for the very latest version of Android 7 Nougat that also work on older Android devices running older versions of the Android operating system.

  

















































·      Download, install and configure the necessary (free) software.

  

















































·      Create your first app.

  

















































·      Build a range of apps demonstrating key aspects of the Android framework.

  

















































·      Test your apps on emulators or a real Android phone or tablet.

  

















































·      You’ll learn Java programming because Android app development requires knowledge of Java. Included are Java tutorial videos that will get you up to speed fast.

  

















































·      Ensure your apps work with current and older Android versions on phones and tablets.

  

















































·      Use Android studio 2.3, the newest version of Google's premier Android tool.

  

















































·      Learn how to use databases, web services, and even get your apps to speak!

  

















































·      Understand the all new Constraint layout, for ""drag and drop"" screen creation.

  

















































·      Use powerful libraries of code to play videos, download website data, manipulate images, and a whole lot more!

  

















































To reinforce what you’ve learnt during the course, there are numerous challenges designed to help you understand each concept being taught. You’re also shown the solution to the challenge so you know you’re always on the right track.

  

















































The course is continually updated and enhanced, and fully supports Android Nougat as it evolves. New content is added each week, guaranteeing what you’re learning is relevant for you today and will never be obsolete.

  

















































With many courses, it’s just set and forget. But not with mine! I’ve got a PROVEN track record of continually updating and adding new content. An example is my Java Masterclass course which now has 65 hours of content and counting, and benefited a whopping 80,000 students.

  

















































And if you have any doubts about the course, be blown away by the glowing reviews left by students on this page.

  

















































Your instructors are me and Jean-Paul Roberts. Between us we have a collective 60 years of commercial software development experience, meaning you’re learning the right way to program to maximize your future development potential.

  

















































Here’s what’s important. There’re a lot of people out there teaching Android Nougat who are not developers. We’re developers with many years’ experience with the Android platform, who also teach Android Nougat.

  

















































Importantly, our courses teach students the real-life skills needed to get those in-demand jobs or further your programming skills.

  

















































Take this course in confidence today knowing you have just found the BEST Android 7 Nougat/Android 8 Oreo course on Udemy! 

 

 Don't delay. Every minute you’re not learning Android 7 is a missed opportunity for that PERFECT high paying job.

The median UI designer salary in the U.S. is $70,000/year for entry-level, and $95,000/year for a seasoned UI Designer. That's totally understandable when you think about it. UI Designers and software engineers are the ones who create something out of nothing. Their imagination, creativity, positive-mindset skill-set and experience deserve to be awarded for pushing high quality and popular products on the market. Knowing that, now it's the right time for you to take things into your own hands and start working towards that goal.This course will provide you with all the necessary knowledge needed to start building your career as UI designer. In this course we will design an Android Application following all Material Design Guidelines. You'll learn not just how to create beautiful design but also the fundamentals, rules and Guidelines of Material System in general.So what is this so called Material Design?Material is a design system created by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web. Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces re-imagine the mediums of paper and ink.We are going to cover Material Design which in this course is primarily focused on Android platform, but the things we learn can also be applied to other platforms as well, with just slight modifications.So what are we going to design you might be asking?Well we are going to create a simple and elegant design for Food Recipes application. We are going to design up to 17 different screens with various material design components like Top app bar, banners, bottom navigation, buttons, floating action buttons, cards, chips, dialogs, menus, snackbars, bottom sheets, tabs and more.You'll learn how to apply Material Design color System to your project, how to combine different fonts in your project and choose typography type scale system. The type scale is a combination of thirteen font styles that are supported by the type system. As a design tool we are going to use Adobe Xd. And That's one of the best FREE vector software's out there, with simple, easy to use and user friendly interface. The knowledge you gather throughout this course with Adobe Xd can also be applied to many different areas of graphic design. You can use Adobe Xd for UI/UX design, to design mobile, web, desktop applications, logos, banners, illustrations and basically everything you could think of.And at the end of this course as a bonus I'm going to show you the basics of prototyping with Adobe Xd. You will learn how to give your design a life with transition animations. Even if prototyping is not in a scope of this course, I'm going to show you some prototyping fundamentals as well.

821,3573765,"Android TDD Masterclass - Coroutines, Jetpack","The TDD Masterclass by Petros Efthymiou.Learn State of the Art Android development by building a real production app.Are you following dozens of forums, articles and buying courses in order to move your development skills and career to your next level? I am too, but more often than not, after completing them I realise that there is still a HUGE amount of work left to be done, to connect all the pieces together and make them work on a real application. I found that even though a course was providing comprehensive knowledge on coroutines it didn't mean that I knew how to integrate them with Retrofit, Live data or Hilt. And because another course was extensive on Test Driven Development after completing it I didn't know how to write an application with TDD using the latest Android tech stack. After buying courses, reading articles  forums and a couple of months of hands-on practise I have finally learned how to combine Android 11 best development practises in an Android application.I created this course to make the process easier for you! You are going to learn how to combineKotlinCoroutinesLive DataKotlin FlowRetrofitHiltJetpack NavigationMVVMAnd complete a real Android application purely on Outside-In Test Driven DevelopmentYou are going to learn how to write not flaky espresso tests in a real scenario with delays and HTTP calls, without using Thread.sleep(). After all we wouldn't be doing TDD without efficient  effective Espresso UI tests!Why Me?Even though I am new to Udemy I am not new to the industry. I have been working as an Android engineer from junior to lead positions in ambitious startups  large multinational companies for about 8 years. Being a good engineer though doesn't automatically mean that you are a good Instructor as well. In the past 5 years I have also discovered my passion for education and worked as a Software Instructor in several colleges and companies, including New York College, Hellenic American Union and my current position now is a Mobile Trainer in a Multinational company called Backbase, where I am trainingThe internal RnD engineersThe internal professional services engineersExternal third party integratorsIn my lifetime I have trained thousands of developers both in classroom, web conferences and video courses.Why is it important?As we are advancing to more senior engineering levels we realise that how we do things is equally important to getting them done. The industry has started to realise that a serious Software Engineering company cannot anymore base the products in purely architectures and engineering practises.I often say that there are 3 stages in the advancement of an engineerIn the first stage he/she is a programmer. He is learning how to make things work e.g. how to add buttons in an Android application and handle it's click. But is not aware of the importance of doing things well. He or she cannot realise that a purely structured system is certain to backfire in the long run and while everything initially seemed to be going well, ""suddenly"" it is impossible to work with this system anymore. New features are hard to be added, and bugs very often slip to production codeIn the second stage having realised the past mistakes the professional starts practising and learning good engineering patterns. He or she starts exploring things like :SOLID PrinciplesDesign patternsClean architectureSeparation of concernsLow coupling, High cohesionUnit Testingand if is passionate and dedicated enough manages to reach a more senior level and is able to develop systems that can be successful not only in the short but also in the long runThe final stage is the Mastery. This stage is an ongoing process and doesn't ever end. After the engineer has a good understanding of the above practises he realises there is a huge room of improvement. He learns how to apply them and most importantly when they are not required and simpler-junior level approaches are more beneficial for the specific project/situation. In other words it is a constant effort to learn how to neverUnder-EngineerOr Over-Engineer.He or she also comes in touch with more advanced practises like Test Driven Development which takes quite a lot of effort to get a grasp and master it.In this course I will do my best to advance you in this path. I will offer to you what I have learned on my journey and I am also very open to learn from you. I am always available on the forums to support and discuss topics that you might have a different point of view and this way we can help each other on our endless road in Software Mastery.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/android-11-tdd-masterclass/,533,Mobile Development,119,117,Petros Efthymiou,"Basic Coding Knowledge

822,1693808,Android Unit Testing and Test Driven Development,"This course will teach you all you need to know about Unit Testing and Test Driven Development in Android applications. It's designed to get you up and running with unit testing using Android Studio and JUnit in no time by working through a series of carefully crafted hands-on exercises.What's unit testing?Unit testing is a practice of writing narrowly scoped automated tests to ensure correctness of your production code. These automated tests allow you to write code that has fewer bugs and is safer to work with in the long term. If you do unit testing, you can write higher quality Android applications that are easier to maintain.What's test driven development?Test driven development (TDD) is a set of special unit testing techniques that mandate writing the tests before the production code. While TDD might look complicated on the first sight, I'll show you that it's actually the easiest way to do unit testing.What's the importance of unit testing in Android?Unit testing is widely considered one of the most important skills for senior Android developers to have. It's a great investment into medium- and long-term professional career growth.If bugs slip into your Android application, it can be very challenging to locate and fix them. Furthermore, even after you fix the bugs, it can take days or even weeks until all your users update the app to actually receive these fixes. That's a tough reality of professional Android developer's job. Fortunately, you can greatly reduce the number of bugs in your applications by unit testing your code!To make your applications unit testable, you'll need to write decoupled code that follows best design principles. This automatically guarantees easier long-term maintenance. In addition, unit testing makes developing Android applications easier and spares a lot of time when done right. Why you should take this course:This course is designed to introduce you to professional grade Android unit testing in the shortest amount of time. I assume that you already know Java and have experience building Android apps. Therefore, this course will not waste your time on Java and Android basics. You'll practice what you learn in this course with carefully designed exercises and gradually build up your unit testing skill.  This course is aimed at professional Android developers who have no prior experience in unit testing. However, I'm confident that even experienced Android unit testers will find much new and valuable information in it.So, if you're interested in learning professional grade unit testing in Android apps - this course is for you.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/professional-android-unit-testing/,331,Mobile Development,61,61,Vasiliy Zukanov,"Experience with Android (preferably 6 months or more)

Thanks, Max!As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.This Course uses TypeScriptTypeScript is the main language used by the official Angularteam and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angularapps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angularapps. Check out the free videos for more information.TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.Why Angular?Angularis the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angularallow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.Angular 13simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular(=Angular 13)you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.Get a very deep understanding of how to create AngularapplicationsThis course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more!

846,1204590,Angular Advanced MasterClass & FREE E-Book,"Would You Like to Build Your Own Open Source Library?Probably all of us developers have thought at some point in time to build our own library and contribute to the overall open source community. The goal of this course is to give you all the tools necessary for you to be able to do your own open source Angular Library.We will build a series of small open source libraries of progressively increasing difficulty, and we will learn a large number of Angular advanced features in a very fun and practical way.What Is The Best Way To Learn Advanced Angular Features?The best way to learn Angular and its most advanced features is to simply take and use it to build something very concrete, like for example an application or a library - and do it in a step-by-step way, as there is no replacement for that experience.In order to understand a technology, we really need to build something non-trivial with it - blog posts and docs will only get us so far.This is of course very time-consuming to do without any help because we will have to learn everything by ourselves along the way as we build something, gluing together an endless number of blog posts, documentation and Stackoverflow answers.So because of this, in order to really dive deep into Angular we will be using it to build a series of small reusable libraries. The goal is to create a practice scenario, and learn the advanced features of Angular in their original use cases, where they make the most sense and so are easier to learn.What Libraries Will We Build In This Course?We will be building the following libraries, and learn how to publish them on NPM using the Angular Package Format: We will start by doing a Font Awesome customizable Input Box and learn the advantages of designing our components using content projection over a more input/output based design. At this stage we will also introduce the Angular Testing ecosystem.Then we will progressively increase the difficulty of each library: we will build a dynamic tab container that allows to receive a template as a component input, effectively allowing to override parts of the component template while keeping a default look and feel for the component.We will then build a reusable dynamic modal component with customizable content. This component have its contents configurable via either content projection or an input template, and will introduce the notion of Structural Directives.We will also learn how directives and components of a given module can interact in a transparent way, independently of the place where they are used in the template, using a shared library service. We will then build a Input mask directive, where we will cover some advanced keyboard handling behavior.At the end of the course, we are going to take all the components and directives that we built in previous sections, and we are going to build one larger example using them: A Payment Modal Widget!We will then introduce the Angular Animations module, and use it to animate the modal widget, we will see how to define animations that can be reused across components.What Will you Learn In this Course?We will learn how to create an AOT compatible library in the Angular Package Format, how to define a library module, how to isolate the styles of a component but still make them customizable, how to design components and directives to make them easier to maintain - making them customizable while at the same time giving the components great default behavior.We will cover all of the more advanced features of Angular, including Component API Design, Component Styling best practices, Templates and Template Outlets, ng-content, ng-container, style isolation and customization, AOT, global events, debugging with the CLI, @ViewChildren, @ContentChildren, Light DOM vs Shadow DOM, @HostBinding, @HostListener, dynamic components, directives, handling keyboard events, testing, animations and more (this is a non-extensive list).But more than presenting the features in isolation, we will use them in real use cases which will make the features much easier to learn.What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?By the end of this course you will know many of the most advanced features of Angular, but most of all you will know when to use them and why. You will know how to build open source Angular libraries, and know how to make them available to the open source community on NPM.With this advanced course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Angular: you will very likely be able to tackle the more advanced Angular development tasks that you will come across in your day to day job or personal projects.Have a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/angular-advanced-masterclass/,411,Web Development,78,74,Angular University,"Basic knowledge of Angular

This type of application usually has a large number of complex data entry forms, with all sorts of complex form validation rules.Angular provides us with all the tools that we need to build these complex forms in a scalable and user-friendly way via the Angular Forms module.There are two types of forms available: template-driven and reactive forms, and we will cover both types of forms in detail in this course. We will also compare them and explain when to use each form type and why.Course OverviewWe will start this course by implementing a simple form using template-driven forms and ngModel. We will understand exactly how ngModel and ngForm work under the hood and the several ways of using these directives for both data binding and form validation.We will learn template-driven forms in detail, including how to build custom form validators using custom directives. Next, we will refactor the same template-driven form that we have built into a reactive form, and we will compare the two approaches.We will then use reactive forms to build a much more complex data entry form with all sorts of different types of controls, nested groups, arrays of controls, custom validators, asynchronous validators, multi-field validations, form draft pre-saving, and much more.The multi-step reactive form that we will be building will be something very close to what you will find in a production application, and it allow us to easily demonstrate all the powerful features of reactive forms in one large step-by-step exercise.We will learn how to build reusable nested forms (like an address form), and we will also cover file upload in detail. We will build a custom file upload control with a progress indicator and cancel upload capabilities.We will finish the course by providing a complete example demonstrating how to use Form Arrays.Table of ContentsThis course covers the following topics:Introduction to the Angular Forms moduleAngular Material form componentsTemplate-driven Forms - how does ngModel work?Typical Form validation rulesForm field validation error messagesUsing ngModel for one-way binding and bi-directional data bindingUnderstanding ngModelOptions in detailTemplate-driven form custom validatorHow to use the FormBuilder serviceRefactoring of a form from template-driven to a reactive formComparison between template-driven and reactive forms - when to use each and whyWhy are they called reactive forms?

Angular by itself is an amazing framework, that together with the Angular CLI makes our life as developers simpler than ever. But imagine what it would mean if adopting this new framework would mean also that we would have to write manually our own form controls as well: such as for example date pickers, dropdowns and other commonly needed widgets.



Developing solid form controls, containers, navigation menus and modal components on top of pure Angular still requires a lot of time and effort, especially if we are looking for a consistently themed component suite with commonly needed advanced features such as for example great ergonomics, design and user experience (including animations).



The good news is that we don't have to do that anymore because together with Angular we now have available an amazing suite of Material Design components, ready to be used! And that is what this course is all about: The Angular Material component suite.



Course Overview



We will start first by scaffolding an Angular Material application for scratch from an empty folder, add it a theme and gesture support. Next, we will start exploring the Angular Material components starting with some navigation menu and icons.



The goal here is to show that its also possible to use Angular Material components also in a more incremental way, by mixing Angular Material Components with a couple of custom-made components and just some HTML/CSS. Later in this section, we will use a more advanced menu system where Angular Material is essentially taking over the whole application layout, with a side menu component.



We are then going to introduce container components such as for example Tab Containers and Material Cards, and we will show a complete example of how to use a data table with a data source, pagination and sorting. We will also show how to use Modals to edit some of data in the data table, for which we will use multiple different types of form components to build an editable form: date pickers, slider, and more.



At the end of the course, we will show we can customize the look and feel of the Angular Material component suite, by building our own custom theme.



What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?



You will be able to comfortably build an Angular application using Angular Material and the Angular CLI. You will be able to scaffold an application from an empty folder, and have gestures and animations working out of the box.



You will be able to setup the navigation menu of the application using the Angular Router and different types of Angular Material menus. You will be able to setup the main layout of your application using standard Angular Material container components such as Tab Containers or Cards, and use common components such as: data tables, lists, date pickers, and all sorts of form controls.



You will be able to build your own Modal dialogs, setup a custom theme and much more, and you will be able to focus your development effort on building the application core functionality itself, instead of building the infrastructure-level UI widgets, the UI design and the enhanced user experience that we get immediately out of the box with Angular Material.

860,1391332,Angular Progressive Web Apps (PWA) MasterClass & FREE E-Book,"This Course In a Nutshell - Part 1 Angular Service Worker (includes the Typescript Jumpstart Ebook)

In the first part of the course we are going to dive straight into the Angular Service Worker and the built-in Angular CLI PWA support. We are going to take as the starting point a plain Angular Application, and we are going to start adding PWA features on top of it in order to turn it into a Progressive Web Application.





We will start by adding the Angular Service Worker and have the Application Download  Installation feature up and running. We will learn all about Application Version Management and we will learn about the multiple caching strategies available for caching not only the application bundles, but also the application data.





We will then add an Application Shell using the Angular CLI and Angular Universal, and make the application One-Click Installable using an App Manifest. Finally we will add Push Notifications to the application using the Angular Service Worker, for a complete mobile-like PWA experience.





This Course In a Nutshell - Part 2 - Service Workers Fundamentals





In this second part, you will learn about Progressive Web Applications in general (including Service Workers, App Manifest, and the Cache Storage API.), and you will use these APIs to implement several native-like features: One-Click Install, Offline support, application download and installation, application data caching and more.





We will also learn Service Worker Web Fundamentals from first principles using built-in browser APIs directly and we will confirm our understanding of what is going on in every step of the way using the PWA built-in Chrome Dev Tools.





The knowledge learned on this section has a long shelf live, as its about browser fundamentals and how the new PWA Web works in general, so everything learned here is still applicable to any other development platform other than Angular.





Why PWAs? Build the Future Of the Web Today





The future of the Web is clearly going in one direction: Progressive Web Applications! With the upcoming Safari support and the ability to install a PWA directly to a Windows desktop, PWAs are the new generation of web applications that will bridge the gap towards Native Apps: this will even include in the near future things like Bluetooth and Payments.





PWAs look and feel like native apps, but there is no App Store and all its issues involved: instead a web application can now be installed directly to the user desktop or home screen with one single click!





The application will then install itself immediately on the background, so that it does not have to be downloaded again unless a new version is available.





The application will feel blazing fast in a way that until now only native apps could: A PWA is offline, background sync and notification capable.





PWAs are not mobile-specific: any application can benefit from starting up an order of magnitude faster! The Angular CLI PWA support and the Angular Service Worker take PWA features to another level: we will be able to add PWA features reliably to our application in a transparent way via the Angular CLI, as part of the production build process.





But we will still need to understand how PWA features work under the hood, in order to troubleshoot any issues, interact with the Angular Service Worker or configure the Angular CLI.





Course Overview





In part 1, we are going to take PWA features one at a time.These features where designed to be used together, so using them to implement a concrete use case is the best way to learn them. The main component of a PWA is a Service Worker, so that is our starting point.





We are going to learn all about the Service Worker lifecycle, how multiple versions of the service worker are handled by the browser, and we will learn multiple Service worker installation and activation GOTCHAs. We are then going to build a service worker that gives to an application the ability of showing an offline page when the network is down, using the Cache API.





Most of the PWA APIs are Promise-based, so to make the code more readable we are going to be using Async / Await in our examples. We are then going to implement Application Download and Installation: we are going to see how we can use a Service Worker to completely download a version of the website into a user's mobile or desktop, and how to handle the installation of multiple versions of the application.





We are going to demo the performance benefits of caching the complete application locally by simulating a slow network, and learn how to clean previous versions of an application. We will also learn how to cache UI-specific data and derived View Model data on the client side using Indexed DB and a Service Worker, and we will also earn how to implement Background Sync.





The next section of the course will cover all about the App Manifest and how to configure that one-click installation experience that we are looking for. After that, we will inspect our application with the Lighthouse tool and analyze the generated report.





The last part of this PWA fundamentals section will cover Web Push and Notifications. In this section, we are going to setup a node server with Web Push capabilities, and then we are going to link it to our service worker in order to implement mobile-like Notifications.





What Will you Learn In this Course?





You will learn how the PWA Browser features work in general, not only in the context of an Angular application. You will know how to analyze and troubleshoot PWAs using the Chrome PWA Dev Tools. You will also learn how to leverage the Angular Service Worker, and all the Angular CLI PWA features to build PWA-enabled web applications.





What Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?





You will be able to design, develop and troubleshoot PWAs, plus you will know how to quickly add PWA features to an Angular Application leveraging the Angular CLI and the Angular Service Worker.

861,3202558,Angular Router In Depth,"This Course in a NutshellIn this course, we are going to learn in detail the advantages of building a frontend UI as a single-page application, as opposed to a traditional multi-page application.Single-page applications (or SPAs) have been around for years now, and are today more popular than ever as a simplified way to build enterprise frontends or internet product dashboards.SPAs typically give the end-user a much better user experience, due to their better-perceived performance and responsiveness. In this course, we will learn how to use the Angular Router to turn our Angular application into a SPA.Course OverviewWe are going take as a starting point a small Angular application that does not have any routing yet. We are then going to learn how to configure the Angular Router from scratch. We will assume no prior Angular Router knowledge, as we explain everything from first principles.We will start by introducing the essential router concepts such as route configuration, paths, router outlets, and router navigation links. From these essential concepts, will build a much more advanced routing scenario.We will learn how to build a master-detail with detail-to-detail navigation scenario, and we will use this example to introduce all the advanced routing concepts and powerful features that the Angular Router offers us.This will include lazy loading modules, data pre-fetching with Resolvers, protecting route access with Guards, custom pre-loading strategies, secondary outlets (auxiliary routes), and much more.Table of ContentsThis course covers the following topics:What is a single page application?Best practices for router configuration: home route, page not found route, etc.Essential Router configurations concepts: paths, components, and outletsEssential Router navigation concepts; the routerLink and routerLinkActive directivesRelative vs Absolute routing best practicesUnderstanding Path matching and router configuration orderRouter Path and Query parametersRouter redirectsDeep linking with the Angular router: master-detail with detail-to-detail navigation scenarioUnderstanding router snapshots vs router observablesLazy loaded routesRoute data pre-loading with ResolversRouter module pre-loading strategies, building a custom preloading strategyRouter Guards - CanActivate and CanActivateChild Authentication GuardsPreventing route exits with CanDeactivate guardsChecking if a lazy-loaded module can be loaded with CanLoadRouter Loading IndicatorUnderstanding Router Hash location strategySecondary router outlets and auxiliary routesThe router module extra configuration options: enableTracing, scrollPositionRestoration, paramsInheritanceStrategy, etc.What Will You Learn In this Course?At the end of this course, you will feel comfortable setting up the Angular Router from scratch in an existing Angular application.You will know not only the essentials of the router together with all its most advanced features, but most importantly you will know exactly when to use each feature and why, and you will know numerous best practices that will help you to make the most out of the Angular Router.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/angular-router-course/,291,Web Development,35,32,Angular University,"Some Angular is essential, but not at an advanced level","Code in Github repository with downloadable ZIP files per section

862,1302770,Angular Security Masterclass (with FREE E-Book),"The course is an Web Application Security Fundamentals Course, where the application will use the Angular/Node stack.All the server code is in Typescript, but the security concepts explained in it are applicable to other technology stacks.This courseincludes an auxiliary Ebook - The Typescript Jumpstart EbookWe will use several MIT licensed Angular and Node packages from Auth0 (that you could use in your application), and we will also include a demo of how to use Auth0 for doing Application User Management.Its important to realize that this is NOT an Auth0 specific course. Auth0 will be the source of a couple of open source packages we will use, and will be doing a quick demo of it to show how JWT makes it simple to delegate authentication to a third-party system, which could be developed in-house as well.Security - A Fundamental Step in a Software Development CareerSecurity is probably the number one advanced topic that Software Developers are expected to master when going forward in their software development careers.Security knowledge is hard to come by but its essential for advancing to more senior software development positions, like for example Application Architect or similar.Learning Web Security Fundamentals, knowing how to design an application for security, and knowing how to recognize and fix security issues is an essential skill for a senior developer.But the problem is that security knowledge is orthogonal to most other topics and it typically takes years to learn.The good news is that once you have it, Security knowledge has a much longer shelf live than most software development knowledge in general.Most of the vulnerabilities and fixes that you will learn in this course were useful 10 years ago, and will (very likely) still be useful 10 years from now - Angular and Node are just an example of one stack, to make the course examples more practical.Security is seen as something really hard to master - this is actually not the case! Application Security is much more approachable than you might think, depending on how you learn it.What Is The Best Way To Learn Security in a Fun and Practical Way?Here is what we will do: we are going to take the skeleton of a running application that has no security yet, and we are going to secure the application step-by-step.Using a couple of MIT packages from Auth0 (that you would be able to use in any project), we are going to implement the Sign-Up and Login functionality from scratch, and because security cannot be enforced only at the client-side, we will implement both the frontend in Angular and the backend in Node.As we secure the application, and we are going to periodically attack the application many times during the course, to prove that the vulnerabilities are real!!By doing so, we will learn along the way the fundamentals of Authentication and Authorization, we will become familiar with common vulnerabilities like Dictionary Attacks, CSRF and others, and we will get familiar with commonly used cryptographic tools like Hashing, Salting, JWT, password storage recommendations and more.Please don't be intimidated by these concepts: The focus in this course will not be on the internals of each of the cryptographic tools that we will use, but instead on understanding on a high-level what problems do these tools solve, when to use each and why.We will also learn how to design our application for security, and we will learn how in many situations application design is ou best defense.Course OverviewWe will start at the beginning: we will see the proper way of doing User Management and Sign Up: we will learn how to store passwords in a database, and we will introduce cryptographic hashes in an approachable way.Once we have the Sign-Up functionality in place, we will implement Login and understand the need for a temporary identity token. Our first implementation will be stateful login, where the token is kept at the server level.And at this point we could think we have authentication in place, but we decide to prepare our application for scalability, so we decide to try a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based approach, because we know that this is what services like Firebase and Auth0 use.We will use a couple of Auth0 packages to quickly refactor our Login to be JWT based, and learn the advantages of using JWT, and some potential disadvantages as well.We will then see how its also possible to do Authentication using a third-party JWT-based service like Auth0, effectively removing all authentication logic from both our codebase and our database, and delegating it to a third-party service.Note that this Auth0-specific part is only a small part of the course, and its main goal is to show how its possible at an enterprise level to delegate authentication to a centralized service, whithout having to introduce direct communication between applications and the centralized authentication service.This means that if you can't use Auth0 at your company, you can apply the same design principles and design a JWT-solution that delegates authentication to a centralized server behind the firewall.We will then cover how to do UI-level role-based functionality in Angular using the Angular Router, and a custom directive for showing or hiding certain parts of the UI depending on the role of the user. We will learn why the Router cannot enforce actual security.We will also talk about server-side Authorization, and we will implement a commonly needed security-related Admin Level functionality: The Login As User service, that allows an admin to login as any user, to investigate a problem report. We can see why we would need to secure this functionality!At the end of all these vulnerabilities and security fixes, we will have a well secured application and we will have learned a ton of security-related concepts along the way in a fun and practical way!What Will you Learn In this Course?With this course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Web Application Security Fundamentals, and you will have gained the practical experience of applying those concepts by defending an application from a series of security attacks. You will have done so by actually performing many of the attacks!You will have learned these concepts in the context of an Angular/Node application, but these concepts are applicable to any other technology stack.You will learn what built-in mechanisms does Angular provide to defend against security problems, and what vulnerabilities it does NOT defend against and why.You will be familiar with best practices for password storage, custom authentication service design and implementation, you will know the essentials about cryptographic hashes, be familiar with JWT and several commonly used open source Auth0 packages.You will be familiar with the following security vulnerabilities: Dictionary attacks, identity token highjacking techniques, the browser same-origin policy, how to combine cookies with JWTs and why, Cross--Site Request Forgery or CSRF, common design vulnerabilities, and more.You will know common practical solutions for securing both enterprise and public internet applications, such as how to use JWT to delegate authentication to a centralized service, which could be Auth0 or a in-house developed service that follows similar principles.You will know how to implement UI-level authorization and use client-side constructs like Router guards to implement it and even build your own authorization-related UI directives.You will also learn about server side authorization, and how to implement a commonly needed backend service that is only accessible to Admins - Login As User.What Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?This course could help you take your development career to a more senior level, where the knowledge about web application security is essential and a key differentiating factor.If you are a private internet business owner or thinking of launching your own platform, this course will contain most of what you need in practice to secure your own online platform in a robust and effective way.With this course, you will have the knowledge necessary for evaluating many third-party security-related solutions, and you will know where to look for vulnerabilities in your application.You will be able to understand most application-level vulnerability reports that come out of security audits done by third party companies, and you will be able to understand and fix the most commonly reported problems.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/angular-security/,473,Web Development,75,72,Angular University,Just some previous knowledge of Angular and Typescript,"Code in Github repository with downloadable ZIP files per section

This is what you'll learn!













How Angular helps you with styling and animating your web pageWhat ""dynamic"" styling and animating meansHow  you may either style the whole web app or individual components you builtWhich tools Angular offers you to adjust styles at runtimeHow you can use vanilla CSS to build nice transitions and animationsAll about Angular's Animation package: Building, configuring and using triggers, states, styles, transitions and more!Advanced Animation features like Animation groups, keyframes or callbacksHow to animate the appearance and removal of elements/ componentsHow to animate listsHow to animate routingAnd more!













This is what the course offers - but is this course for you?













This course is for you if ...













... you got (basic) Angular and CSS knowledge and feel like you need to learn more about adding/ using styles and animations in your Angular apps... you're learning Angular right now and you want to continue learning with more beautiful apps... you even already know the basics about styling and animating Angular apps but you feel like there still is some mystery regarding the styling/ animation of components

865,2308032,Angular Testing Masterclass (with FREE E-Book),"This Course in a NutshellThis video course, complete with a running Github repository is a complete step-by-step guide to Angular Testing in general. We are going to take a small sample application that is already completed, but that has no tests yet.We are then going to discuss the best approach to test each part of the application, and we are going to write the tests step-by-step, explaining every decision along the way.We are going to start by writing Unit Tests for the multiple parts of the application, and then on a later stage, we are going to learn how to perform End to End (E2E) tests.More than talking about how to test, this course will also cover when to test and why, as well as all sorts of testing best practices.Course OverviewStarting from scratch, we are going to introduce behavior-driven testing concepts, by quickly introducing the main concepts and utilities of the Jasmine Testing framework.We are then going to introduce some testing best practices, and we are going to talk about mocks and Jasmine spies. We will then introduce some of the Angular Testing utilities such as the Angular TestBed, which we will be using to test a couple of simple Angular services.We are then going to move on to test a more complex Angular service and talk about Angular HTTP request mocking, after which we will cover the testing of Angular components.We are going to learn how to test Angular components with and without the DOM, what parts of the component to test, and we are going to cover in detail asynchronous tests using the fakeAsync and async utilities.We will cover how to test several types of typical Angular components, such as for example presentational components and smart or container components, and we will learn how to mock Angular Observable-based services.After unit testing the multiple components of our application, we are going to then create a test suite of End to End tests using Cypress.Once we have the tests written for our application, we are then going to deploy them to Travis CI, and make sure that the tests are triggered with every commit.At the end the course, we are going to generate a test coverage report, and discuss some of the metrics.Table of ContentsThis course will go over the following topics:Introduction to the Jasmine testing frameworkIntroduction to Jasmine spiesUnit Testing of simple Angular ServicesJasmine testing best practicesIntroduction to Angular testing utilitiesTesting of complex Angular servicesMocking of Angular HTTP requestsUnit Testing of Angular ComponentsAsynchronous Angular Testing with fakeAsync and asyncMocking of Observable-based ServicesUnit Testing of Presentational ComponentsUnit Testing of Smart or Container ComponentsSimulation of user interaction in unit testsEnd to End Angular Testing with CypressContinuous Integration with Travis CIAngular CLI Test Coverage ReportsWhat Will You Learn In this Course?With this course, you will feel comfortable writing Angular tests for multiple types of services and components. You will know not only the multiple Jasmine and Angular testing utilities available, but you will also know when to use them and why.You will be familiar with Angular testing best practices, and you will know how to write useful tests that don't take a lot of time to write and that contribute a lot for the long term health of your project.Have a look at the course free lessons, and please enjoy the course!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/angular-testing-course/,308,Web Development,45,41,Angular University,"No prior knowledge of Testing is needed

This will allow us to understand in detail how universal rendering works, and it will give us a lot of flexibility if needed.Once we have our Angular Express application up and running, we will then make it SEO and social-media friendly.We will then apply a couple of common performance optimizations that are commonly used in Angular Universal applications: we will implement from scratch a fine-grained Application shell, and we will also reduce the number of HTTP requests that the application does at startup time by using the State Transfer API.We will then take our fully optimized Angular Universal application and we will deploy it to productionusing Google App Engine for Node.What Will you Learn In this Course?At the end of this course, you will feel comfortable taking your existing Angular Application and turning it into a server side Angular Universal application.You will understand the benefits of server-side rendering, and you will be able to optimize your application for both search engines and social media crawlers.You will also know how to further optimize your universal application for performance, and you will know how to deploy it to production in two different scenarios: pre-rendered apps and runtime server-side rendered apps.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/angular-universal-course/,259,Web Development,32,56,Angular University,Just some previous knowledge of Angular and Typescript,"Code in Github repository with downloadable ZIP files per section

888,1321172,Ansible for Network Engineers: Quick Start GNS3 & Ansible,"Learn Network Automation with GNS3 and Ansible.

Do you want to program networks using Ansible, but not sure where to start? Well, this course will show you how you can start programming Cisco networks within 30 minutes.















This course was created for network engineers. There are too many other Ansible courses out there that try to make network engineers server administrators. They concentrate on server administration, installation of software packages and other server admin tasks.















This course is different. 
















This course is practical. I won't talk about programming in abstract terms and make you wait before you can start automating networks. I will show you how you can quickly and easily start network programming by using GNS3, Cisco IOS and Ansible.















You will see demonstrations of the configuration of both Cisco routers and switches in GNS3. For example, how to configure multiple VLANs on a multiple switches, or how to configure OSPF on a router and more much more.
















Learn how you can use Ansible to troubleshoot networks! Use a single Ansible command to retrieve mac address table information from multiple switches in seconds. Then pipe the output to a regular expression to filter down to a single MAC address.You will never troubleshoot networks the same way again!















This course shows you practical examples of using Ansible to programmatically configure Cisco network devices rather then just talking about it.
















The days of configuring Cisco networks only with the command line interface (CLI) are drawing to a close. You need to add network programmability using Ansible to your skill set.















Learn how to automate networks using:
















- SSH
















- Ansible Network modules















- Ansible Playbooks















- Ansible ad hoc commands















Don't reinvent the wheel. Use the tools available to you to quickly and easily automate your networks.


















Here are some comments about my automation courses:















""Knowing the material from just the first video would have saved me hours of work and rework in the past."" 
















""It's the easiest, most fun, and most valuable course I've completed yet on Python Programming for Networking. Love it! Thanks again David!!!"" Darby Weaver















""Excellent course on Network Programming using Python with lot's of practical network configuration examples.""
















""Great way of explanation.Nice video and inspiring words! Thank you so much David. You are genius.""















""I've been doing network automation for a while, even so, I've learned new things through this course. The instructor start from a basic example, adding improvements in each step. It's a skill that's worth it.""















""A must for all network engineers who want to learn python!!! I had very ""very"" basic programming skills, and couldn't just get the bridge between network and programming (mainly Python - since that's where the hype is now), this course was amazing, I have never been glued to a training course since I can remember.

897,1005210,Ansys Tutorial,"Composite materials are created by combining two or more layered materials, each with different properties. These materials have become a standard for products that are both light and strong. Composites provide enough flexibility so products with complex shapes, such as boat hulls and surfboards, can be easily manufactured. Engineering layered composites involves complex definitions that include numerous layers, materials, thicknesses and orientations. The engineering challenge is to predict how well the finished product will perform under real-world working conditions. This involves considering stresses and deformations as well as a range of failure criteria. ANSYS Composite PrepPost provides all necessary functionalities for the analysis of layered composite structures.This tutorial has been divided to 11 sections. in order to get the best result please follow tutorials step by steps if you are beginners.The first section of this tutorial is an introduction to Ansys software and ACP tools. You will learn how to add ACP tools into project schematic and create very simple geometry. In the second section you will learn about tools inside ACP such as Draping, Rules, Rossete, Orientation. This section is crucial for everyone in order to continue tutorials. This section all tools explained step by step (PLEAEE DO NOT MISS THIS SECTION) In the third section, you will learn how to model T beam shape in ANSYS ACP and do stress Analsys. This is a good example for beginners to test their modelling skills in ACP software.Buckling is one of the important subject in composite material. Therefore, the whole section four is dedicated to this matter to find eigenvalue for simple composite plate  ACP tool can be coupled with other ACT extensions such had honeycomb creator. In this section, you will learn how to create honeycombs and combine that with composite model in ACP. In the section sixth, seventh and eighth you will learn how to combine model with mechanical model and ACP. Three different mechanical examples have been solved with ACP and mechanical model in ANSYS workbench.

We have taken enough care to explain all necessary and complex Kafka Architecture concepts to help you come up to speed and grasp the content of this course. About the CourseI am creating Kafka Streams - Real-time Stream Processing to help you understand the stream processing in general and apply that knowledge to Kafka Streams Programming. This course is based on my book on the same subject with the same title. My Book is already published and is available with all major online retailers as an eBook and Paperback. My approach to creating this course is a progressive common-sense approach to teaching a complex subject. By using this unique approach, I will help you to apply your general ability to perceive, understand, and reason the concepts progressively that I am explaining in this course.Who should take this Course?Kafka Streams - Real-time Stream Processing course is designed for software engineers willing to develop a stream processing application using the Kafka Streams library. I am also creating this course for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organization’s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Kafka implementation, but they work with the people who implement Kafka Streams at the ground level.Kafka Version used in the CourseThis course is using the Kafka Streams library available in Apache Kafka 2.x. I have tested all the source code and examples used in this course on Apache Kafka 2.3 open source distribution. Some examples of this course also make use of the Confluent Community Version of Kafka. We will be using Confluent Community Version to explain and demonstrate functionalities that are only available in the Confluent Platform, such as Schema Registry and Avro Serdes. Source Code, Development IDE, Build Tool, Logging, and Testing ToolsThis course is fully example-driven, and I will be creating many examples in the class. The source code files for all the examples are included in your study material. This course will be making extensive use of IntelliJ IDEA as the preferred development IDE. However, based on your prior experience, you should be able to work with any other IDE designed for Java application development.This course will be using Apache Maven as the preferred build tool. However, based on your prior experience, you should be able to use any other build tool designed for Java applications.This course also makes use of Log4J2 to teach you industry-standard log implementation in your application.We will be using JUnit5, which is the latest version of JUnit for implementing Unit Test Cases.Example and ExercisesWorking examples and exercises are the most critical tool to convert your knowledge into a skill. I have already included a lot of examples in the course. This course also consists of objective questions and some programming assignments as and when appropriate.

922,1141696,Apache Kafka Series - Kafka Connect Hands-on Learning,"A Comprehensive and Brand New Course for Learning Apache Kafka Connect Framework with Hands-on Training – (Launched in April 2017)Kafka Connect is a tool for scalable and reliable streaming data between Apache Kafka and other data systems. Apache Kafka Connect is a common framework for Apache Kafka producers and consumers. 

 Apache Kafka Connect offers an API, Runtime, and REST Service to enable developers todefine connectors that move large data sets into and out of ApacheKafka in real time. It inherits strong concepts such asfault-tolerance and elasticity thanks to being an extension of Apache Kafka. Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases,collect metrics, gather logs from all your application servers into Apache Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. 

 Kafka Connect standardises integration of other data systems with ApacheKafka, simplifying connector development, deployment, and management.

 In this course, we are going to learn theKafka Connector deployment, configurationand management with hands-on exercises. We are also going to see the distributed and standalone modes to scale up to a large, centrally managed service supporting an entire organisation or scale down to development, testing, and small production deployments. The REST interface to submit and manage connectors to your Kafka Connect cluster via an easy to use REST API’s.

929,1590708,Apache Kylin : Implementing OLAP on the Hadoop platform,"A Comprehensive Course for Learning How to Build and Query Big Data OLAP Cubes Using Apache Kylin.

Apache Kylin is an Apache top-level project that bring OLAP to Big data. This simply means that we can now write complex aggregation queries with different levels of aggregation and expect to get a second or micro-seconds response to our query. 

Online analytical processing (OLAP) has been a common word in traditional business intelligence for years but has not been easy with hadoop platform that has become a data lake solution for many.  These data lake often have hundreds of millions and even billions of records that organizations want to slice and dice for insights. However, the high latency of query execution in SQL on Hadoop technologies like Apache Hive or Apache Drill often meant that data architect opted to transfer their data back to traditional systems that allow for real time response to query.

Kylin solves all of this. 

With Apache Kylin, anyone with the skills can now build OLAP, ROLAP or MOLAP structures using a web UI, deploy it and expect to query these structure with second of response time in mind. Also, one can connect their applications or favorite visualization tools to Kylin to integrate data either for system processing or for visualization. 

In this course, we are going to review 

What Kylin isHow it worksHow to build OLAP cubes in batch and streaming modelHow to deploy the cubesHow to query cubesHow to connect external tools and applications to Kylin.. and many moreWhat is the target audience?

Big Data Engineers/DevelopersData ArchitectsData Analysts.Anyone who wishes to be able to write simple to complex aggregation queries of large dataset and wants a low latency response time.What are the requirements?

You need access to a Big Data Sandbox like Cloudera quickstart VM, Hortonworks HDP sandbox or a cloud-based Hadoop environment with a least 10GB of Ram.You should have some familiarity SQL and be able to use ODBC or JDBC based tools.Some familiarity with Linux will be helpfulWhat do I need to know to get the best out of this course?

Because Kylin uses other hadoop projects to achieve its design a fair understanding of projects like Apache Hive, Apache Kafka, Apache HBase, MapReduce is great for this course. However, one can still use Kylin without any knowledge of these technologies. 

It is also worth knowing that no prior knowledge of any big data technology is required to query Kylin or use data integration in running report or data visualizations.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/apache-kylin-implementing-olap-on-the-hadoop-platform/,369,Big Data,43,42,Michael Enudi,"Ability to write a SQL query or use SQL query tool is required to be a Kylin User.

Even though this course is 3 hrs long, it covers many topics without wasting time, and so I felt that despite my previous exposure to courses and hands-on, that I probably benefited from more than half of this course with new and useful material, maybe even 2/3 of it. I'm very happy to see treatment being given to NiFi Registry plus Git integration. I never knew the purpose of the Funnel before, let alone things like clustering with ZooKeeper, making use of the Variable Registry and/or property files, and a working example of building your own custom data processor. Each of these things may have only been touched on somewhat briefly - enough to clear the fog on a topic so you know where to start and what to use it for so that you can then dig into it further yourself if need be.

952,4007248,"API Crash Course: What is an API, how to create it & test it","HelloIn this course we will explain what an API is.API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.What exactly is an API? Finally learn for yourself in this helpful video from MuleSoft, the API experts.When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.To explain this better, let us take a familiar example.Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.Here is a real-life API example. You may be familiar with the process of searching flights online. Just like the restaurant, you have a variety of options to choose from, including different cities, departure and return dates, and more. Let us imagine that you’re booking you are flight on an airline website. You choose a departure city and date, a return city and date, cabin class, as well as other variables. In order to book your flight, you interact with the airline’s website to access their database and see if any seats are available on those dates and what the costs might be.However, what if you are not using the airline’s website––a channel that has direct access to the information? What if you are using an online travel service, such as Kayak or Expedia, which aggregates information from a number of airline databases?The travel service, in this case, interacts with the airline’s API. The API is the interface that, like your helpful waiter, can be asked by that online travel service to get information from the airline’s database to book seats, baggage options, etc. The API then takes the airline’s response to your request and delivers it right back to the online travel service, which then shows you the most updated, relevant information.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/api-course/,199,Software Engineering,33,33,"Tarek Roshdy

954,34897,API in C#: The Best Practices of Design and Implementation,"  	          Learn how to design and implement types in C# so that the other developers won't hate you when using one of the types developed by you. It means you are going to learn how to write code of the high quality: readable, understandable and reliable.  Improve your knowledge in object-oriented programming in the context of clean coding and building types of high quality.Understand the characteristics of a well-designed typeGrasp the principles of the convenient API developmentWrite clean code, get rid of unpleasant smellsLearn about what exceptions are intended for and how to throw and catch them properlyProtect your types from the incorrect usage making them properly encapsulated.Foundations of building object-oriented infrastructures  	Despite the fact that C# is a very rich on features language, it's very common to see poorly designed and implemented types in a real world. In fact, C# is one of the richest on features language among object-oriented languages in the world nowadays. But with great power comes great responsibility. It's challenging  to use all those features in a right way.    	      You probably have already heard the following well-known statement: most code sucks. Well, this course is all about how to produce code which doesn't suck.    	      Owning skills of producing a well-designed and well-implemented types is the prerequisite for the other developers to treat you as a real professional.    	 Content and Overview  This course is aimed at all the C# developers, from beginners to seniors. Topics which are covered in the course are relevant for all kinds of C# developers since all developers design and implement APIs. The topics complexity is very different. There are plenty of very simple topics, and at the same time, there are topics which require from you a solid C# background. There are plenty of code examples throughout this course, so you will learn both theoretical and practical material.  	Starting with characteristics and principles of a well-designed type you will go further, learning how to give names for different members, how many parameters a method should take, is it a good idea to take a Boolean as a parameter of a method and much more than that.    	Then you will learn what encapsulation really means. How to encapsulate a type? There are some trade-offs we will deal with encapsulating our types. There are many experienced programmers who don't know what encapsulation is in essence. Investigating this topic together we will see how to build a consistent and reliable type.    	After mastering the topic of types encapsulating you will face the great problem of exceptions handling. Yep, it's a hard nut to crack. We will start from discussing a question of why do we use exceptions as a mechanism of errors handling. And why C# team didn't invent any other mechanisms?    	In the end, we will look at how to fight with null values. As you may know, Tony Hoar said that the invention of a null value was his billion-dollar mistake.To sum up, the course covers the following topics:API development principlesHow to give better names for API members and what naming conventions exist in the .NET platform and suited for C#.Common problems encountered by C# developers in the process of designing and implementing APIs: classes vs structures, abstract classes vs interfaces, creational patterns vs constructors, how to implement dispose pattern (are you sure you understand this allegedly simple case?)Common implementation smells such as poor naming, excessively long methods, output parameters and so on.Common Architectural Design Smells such as Primitive Obsession, Hidden Dependencies, Violation of Law of Demeter and other.How to deal with errors. It is surprisingly hard to develop robust software where errors handling is based on exceptions. We will find out why this is so and how to struggle with problems of error handling.How to deal with Nulls. Null Vales have always been a pain the ass. NullReferenceException is a well-known and popular guest in our software. We will look at the possible ways of diminishing the disrupting power of null-values.Teaching ApproachNo fluff, no ranting, no beating the air. I esteem your time. The course material is succinct, yet comprehensive. All important concepts are covered. Particularly important topics are covered in-depth.

We use industry standard real eCommerce RESTful API to practice testing using Python programming language.We will build a framework using one of the most popular testing tools PyTest. The framework we will build will be extendable and scalable to be able to include frontend (Selenium WebDriver) testing.The skills learned here are used in any Web Serivces testing.BONUS: SQL Crash CourseYou will learn how to use SQL to read and write to/from databases. We will use MySQL for our main test site so we will use the same database to learn SQL. SQL (sequel) is critical skill for any test engineer (manual or automation needs to know basic SQL).The crash course in SQL is short and precise. Topics only directly related to automation are covered. Great addition to your resume and interview process.Critical addition to your resumeIf you are getting into the QA world or you are looking to advance your career, having API testing skill will accelerate your success. Python is one of the most popular languages to use in software testing, and knowing how to use it for API/Backend testing will expand your pool of possibilities.In addition to using Python for API/Backend testing, the tools we will use are great addition to your resume. We will be using industry standard tools that can be applied to several tasks beyond API testing.After completion of this course you will be able to go through interview as if you have API testing experience. You will also have plenty of APIs to test and practice.Content and OverviewIn this course we will spend some time creating an eCommerce application on our local machine. We will install a package that includes web server and database. Using this package we will install WordPress and install necessary plugins to make it an eCommerce application. The eCommerce application gives us all the APIs we will test. We have access to the database so we will test API data against the 
database. We will create a efficiently structured test framework and 
learn how to use Python to perform our verification.We will 
also learn how to use a Python test runner tool ""pytest"" see why test 
runner tools are critical for automation testing.What am I going to get from this course?35 + lectures (continuously adding more examples)Plenty of APIs (endpoints) for you to practice with   beyond this classEnough material and examples to be able to create a   project and maintain a GitHub repoIndustry standard tools to add to your resume.

While being used extensively already, the applications of quadcopters will only grow in time. Drones will be used in delivery services, entertainment, medicine, military, rescue, structural quality inspection - places that people cannot reach easily, and in many other fields. In many cases, there will be a predefined trajectory in a 3D space that the UAVneeds to follow without human help. In fact, humans might simply give a simple command for the drone to go somewhere, and then, a specific trajectory will be generated by a computer in that direction and the UAV's control algorithms will need to determine EXACTLY how fast each rotor should turn in order to make the drone follow that trajectory with high-degree precision. And that's what this course is all about - its about DESIGNING, MASTERING, and APPLYINGthese control algorithms together with deriving the dynamics equations for the quadcopter.In this course, you will receive a full package when it comes to learning about how to model and control a UAV drone and make it follow a trajectory in a 3D environment. Not only you will learn how to model a UAV system mathematically by deriving the equations of motion using the principles of 3D Dynamics, but you will also be exposed to some of the most powerful control techniques out there such as Model Predictive Control and feedback linearization.In 3D dynamics, you will learn the fundamental math and physics behind the UAV quadcopter drone modelling.

It has been designed to provide a concise but complete knowledge of medical device risk management to supplement readings of the 80-page standard and to initiate those who are new to the medical device industry. More focus has been given to explaining the use of key tools such as the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and the Fault-Tree Analysis (FTA) to enable immediate application in ISO 14971 projects. This course offers a systematic methodology to comprehend medical device risk management and connects the vital elements of risk management methodologies for a more efficient application of principles. It also provides guidelines on how to conduct productive meetings to construct medical device risk profiles.

Why is this course essential to take?





Performing risk management is a regulatory obligation and is the underpinning tool for assessing medical device safety. Risk management is part of the design input requirements during product design  development. This means that risk control and hazard reduction measures must be included as key considerations in the final medical device design, as well as in verification and validation studies. Risk evaluation should occur continuously throughout the production and post-production processes.





An organised and methodical approach to understanding and applying the ISO14971 principles





This ISO 14971 course takes a business approach to medical device risk management. Business tools such as project management techniques are recommended to establish risk management team structures. This ensures an organisation-wide support and commitment to comply with the ISO 14971 requirements. The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and the Fault-Tree Analysis are discussed in greater detail to clearly explain their applicability to medical device risk management.

But is it that easy for a machine to understand it? ... Probably not ... Well, this is exactly what this course is about: learning how to build a Machine Learning model capable of reading and classifying all this news for us!Since 2006, Twitter has been a continuously growing source of information, keeping us informed about all and nothing. It is estimated that more than 6,000 tweets are exchanged on the platform every second, making it an inexhaustible mine of information that it would be a shame not to use.Fortunately, there are different ways to process tweets in an automated way, and retrieve precise information in an instant ... Interested in learning such a solution in a quick and easy way?Take a look below ..._____________________________________________________What will you learn in this course?By taking this course, you will learn all the steps necessary to build your own Tweet Sentiment prediction model. That said, you will learn much more as the course is separated into 4 different parts, linked together, but providing its share of knowledge in a particular field (Text Mining, NLP and Machine Learning).SECTION 1: Introduction to Text MiningIn this first section, we will go through several general elements setting up the starting problem and the different challenges to overcome with text data. This is also the section in which we will discover our Twitter dataset, using libraries such as Pandas or Matplotlib.SECTION 2: Text NormalizationTwitter data are known to be very messy. This section will aim to clean up all our tweets in depth, using Text Mining techniques and some suitable libraries like NLTK. Tokenization, stemming or lemmatization will have no secret for you once you are done with this section.SECTION 3: Text RepresentationBefore our cleansed data can be fed to our model, we will need to learn how to represent it the right way. This section will aim to cover different methods specific to this purpose and often used in NLP (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, etc.). This will give us an additional opportunity to use NLTK.SECTION 4: ML ModellingFinally ... the most exciting step of all! This section will be about putting together all that we have learned, in order to build our Sentiment prediction model. Above all, it will be about having an opportunity to use one of the most used libraries in Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (SKLEARN)._____________________________________________________Why is this course different from the others I can find on the same subject?One of the key differentiators of this course is that it's not about learning Text Mining, NLP or Machine Learning in general. The objective is to pursue a very precise goal (Sentiment Analysis) and deepen all the necessary steps in order to reach this goal, by using the appropriate tools.So no, you might not yet be an unbeatable expert in Artificial Intelligence at the end of this course, sorry ... but you will know exactly how, and why, your Sentiment application works so well._____________________________________________________About AIOutsiderAIOutsider was created in 2020 with the ambition of facilitating the learning of Artificial Intelligence.

1002,1627224,Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with R Projects,"Welcome to the world of R and Time Series Analysis!

At the moment R is the leading open source software for time series analysis and forecasting. No other tool, not even python, comes close to the functions and features available in R. Things like exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, time series cross validation, missing data handling, visualizations and forecasts are easily accessible in R and its add on packages. Therefore, R is the right choice for time series analysis and this course gives you an opportunity to train and practice it.

  

So how is the course structured?

  

This is a hands on course with 3 distinct projects to solve! Each project has a main topic and a secondary topic. Both are discussed on real world data. In the first project you work with trending data, and as a secondary topic you will learn how to create standard and ggplot2 time series visualizations. The dataset for that project will be an employment rate dataset.

  

The second project with the German monthly inflation rates over the last 10 years shows how to model seasonal datasets. And you will also compare the models with time series cross validation. 

  

In the third project you will connect R to yahoo finance and scrape stock data. The resulting data requires loads of pre-processing and cleaning including missing data imputation. Once we prepared the data, we will check out which weekday is the best for buying and selling the Novartis stock.

  

You should know some R to be able to follow along. There is for example the introduction to time series analysis and forecasting course. That course is more a step by step guide while this one is an applied and project based one. Both courses can be taken on their own, or you take a look at both and learn the subject from 2 different angles.

1003,3313824,Applying The Art and Science of Sales Enablement,"What if sales enablement stopped being perceived as a cost center? What if, instead of thinking of it as training, or onboarding, or the resting place for an organization’s broken things, we thought of sales enablement as a strategic investment—a proactive function that actually enables sales to sell more, sell higher and sell faster?The biggest problem with Sales Enablement is that there is no one universal definition. If you were to ask 10 different people “What is Sales Enablement?” you would get 10 different answers, ranging from training to tech to messaging  positioning. None of these answers would be wrong – but none of them would show the whole picture. And when the answer to such an apparently simple question is so complicated, it becomes difficult to convey to senior leaders the value of Sales Enablement.Roderick Jefferson, CEO and top sales enablement consultant, is here to provide some much-needed clarity. After 20+ years in the Sales Enablement space, he has narrowed his definition down to this:Breaking the complexity of the buying  selling process into practical ideas through scalable, repeatable, and measurable practices that leads to decreased time to revenue and increased productivity.If it sounds simple, it isn’t – but it can be done, and in this course, you’ll discover exactly how to do it.In this course you will:Define Sales Enablement and its value to the organizationArticulate the impact Sales Enablement has on revenueUnderstand the roles and responsibilities of a high functioning Sales Enablement teamDevelop a Sales Enablement charter and craft a blueprint to success for your Sales Enablement teamBuild a culture of learning in your sales organization and learn to lead Sales Enablement in a virtual environment",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/applying-the-art-and-science-of-sales-enablement/,42,Sales Skills & Tools,18,18,Roderick Jefferson,"You should be familiar with the sales processes of your organization, including your buyer's journey and selling process","The definition and value of Sales Enablement and what Sales Enablement is NOT

1019,1049802,Apprendre Javascript: Cours Javascript Complet,"+11,818 étudiants, le cours javascript le plus populaire sur le marché français avec une très bonne note générale.L'importance d'apprendre javascript:Alors, vous êtes ici parce que vous voulez apprendre le javascript, mais je veux croire que vous avez des doutes concernant l'apprentissage de javascript, est-ce que javascript est la bonne chose à faire? pour quoi javascript est l'une des langages de programmation les plus importantes? ou bien, qu'est-ce que javascript en premier lieu?Eh bien, il y a beaucoup à dire sur javascript et pourquoi vous devriez l'apprendre maintenant.Javascript est un langage qui vous permet de créer des sites web interactifs. javascript est devenu un élément essentiel de la technologie web avec HTML et CSS, puisque la plupart des navigateurs exécutent javascript, vous devez apprendre javascript si vous voulez faire parti du développement web, et vous devez l'apprendre très bien si vous avez l'intention d'être un développeur Front Office, cela signifie que, quels que soient vos objectifs de développement web, javascript peut vous donner les outils dont vous avez besoin pour aider à les réaliser, et vous devez décider d'aller au-delà de développement Front Office. L’utilisation de javascript est maintenant étendue au développement Back Office, au développement d’applications mobiles, au développement d’applications bureau, au développement de jeux, et d'innombrables autres exemples pourraient être donnés (y compris les appareils domotiques, microcontrôleurs, et même les robots). Votre connaissance de javascript sera quelque chose de précieux que vous pouvez prendre avec vous pour le reste de votre vie.Je peux sentir que vous êtes déjà excité de commencer ce cours javascript et apprendre la premiere base de javascript, mais vous pouvez quand même avoir toujours des doutes, est-ce que javascript est difficile à apprendre (surtout que vous pourriez entendre comment la chaîne de caractères peut devenir complexe)?Eh bien, je peux vous assurer que javascript est facile de commencer, parce que c'est un langage de niveau supérieur, et ce que je veux dire par là, c'est que javascript fait l’abstraction de la majorité des détails complexes de la machine, de cette façon, vous pouvez vous concentrer sur l'apprentissage de programmation, javascript ne nécessite aucune installation ou configuration, vous n'avez même pas à l'acheter, tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour commencer est un navigateur web, et tous les navigateurs modernes prennent en charge javascript sans avoir besoin de plug-ins, vous pouvez littéralement commencer à apprendre le javascript maintenant. Avec javascript, vous pouvez regarder en temps réel, pendant que vos modifications de code affectent les pages que vous visitez, et la meilleure façon de vraiment saisir un nouveau concept est par l'expérimentation, et javascript vous amène à ce point beaucoup plus rapidement et plus facilement que tout autre langage, en utilisant cette formation javascript, vous obtenez beaucoup d’exemples que vous pouvez faire pour tirer le meilleur parti de javascript, d'autant que ce cours javascript est construit en prenant en considération les débutants, donc tout ce que nous faisons dans cette formation javascript, nous nous assurons qu'il est facile pour vous de comprendre et d'appliquer.Quand le monde virtuel continue à se changer et à se prospérer, javascript est devenu encore plus important, et la demande pour les développeurs javascript n'a pas cessé d'être augmenté encore plus, javascript est également la troisième compétence de programmation la plus demandée sur Indeed, et GitHub a classé javascript en tant que langage avec le dépôt le plus actif.Très bien, nous sommes arrivés à la dernière pièce de puzzle et c'est l'avenir de javascript, vous voulez apprendre un langage qui n'est pas seulement facile à commencer, très populaire, demandé, avec un très bon salaire et toutes ces bonnes choses, mais aussi qu’il peut durer pour des années à venir.Eh bien, le navigateur web est l'une des applications les plus utilisées sur les ordinateurs de bureau et mobiles, avec de plus en plus des services qui déménagement au web, le javascript ne fera que croître en popularité, et dans son ensemble, il y a vraiment beaucoup d'innovations techniques dans javascript, donc vous pouvez être sûr que javascript est là pour de bon.Ce que cette formation javascript couvre:Dans cette formation javascript, nous allons commencer par examiner exactement ce qui est javascript, et prendre vos premières étapes avec le langage sous-jacent et la syntaxe. Vous allez découvrir les concepts fondamentaux de la programmation, y compris les données et les types de données, la chaîne de caractères et comment structurer votre code pour prendre des décisions dans vos programmes ou pour répéter la même action ou le même morceau de code de nombreuses fois.Une fois que vous êtes à l'aise avec les bases, vous allez passer à l'une des idées clés en javascript, l'objet. Vous découvrirez comment tirer profit des objets qui sont natifs au langage javascript, par exemple les tableaux, les dates et les expressions régulières, vous découvrirez comment ces objets vous permettent de gérer les données complexes et à simplifier vos programmes.Ensuite, nous allons apprendre à propos des fonctions, qui sont au cœur de la façon dont javascript fonctionne, nous allons également apprendre comment concevoir et utiliser des objets personnalisés. Ensuite, vous verrez comment vous pouvez utiliser javascript pour manipuler et détecter des objets mis à votre disposition par le navigateur. À partir d'ici, vous allez passer à des sujets plus avancés, tels que manipuler dynamiquement des éléments dans une page web et comment déclencher des actions lorsque certaines choses se produisent dans votre page.En utilisant ces savoirs, vous pouvez commencer à créer de véritables applications et sites web avec une solide base de javascript et qui ont un aspect professionnel qui vous permet d'interagir avec l'utilisateur tout comme créer un chatbot.Tous les nouveaux concepts présentés dans cette formation seront illustrés par des exemples concrets toujours avec de code javascript que vous pouvez télécharger , qui vous permettent d'expérimenter avec javascript et construire sur la théorie que vous venez d'apprendre. A la fin de ce cours javascript, vous pouvez télécharger votre certificats de réussite fourni par Udemy.Avant de vous laisser regarder le cours, j'aimerais prendre un moment pour éclairer un peu l'avenir de langage javascript en tant que langage de programmation de création de pages web. Après la guerre des frameworks de la dernière décennie, les "" Trois Grands "", comme certains aiment à les appeler, ouvrent la voie à un avenir plus stable et mieux défini. React, Vue et Angular sont de loin les frameworks et bibliothèques JavaScript les plus utilisés aujourd'hui.React: Construit et soutenu par Facebook, React est un favori parmi les développeurs pour la création et la maintenance de produits, qu'il s'agisse d'un POC rapide ou d'un logiciel de grande entreprise. Il est actuellement utilisé par de nombreuses grandes entreprises comme Instagram, Netflix, Walmart, Whatsapp, et plus encore. Les avantages de React incluent son architecture basée sur les composants, le DOM virtuel pour de grandes performances, une courbe d'apprentissage super rapide et la popularité parmi les développeurs avec une énorme communauté de support. Vous pouvez tout de meme créer un chatbot avec React ce qui est vraiment cool.Vue: Créé par Evan You et adopté par Alibaba, Vue est en train de devenir un favori rapide parmi ceux qui le découvrent. La raison en est que Vue a été initialement conçu pour aider les concepteurs qui avaient peu d'expérience en programmation. Le but était de les aider à se concentrer sur la création d'interfaces fonctionnelles plutôt que de se soucier du codage lui-même. Il était donc très facile à apprendre avec un seuil d'entrée minimal. De plus, Evan, un ancien employé de Google, a observé des choses qui étaient encombrantes ou qui pouvaient être améliorées dans Angular et les a appliquées à Vue. Il a fait la même chose lors de la sortie de React et a réussi à créer un média qui est devenu l'un des cadres les plus prometteurs à apprendre et à adopter. De plus, Vue.js supporte le rendu déclaratif, les mises à jour DOM asynchrones, la liaison de données bidirectionnelle, le respect strict des spécifications des composants Web et une intégration simple avec les modèles HTML.Angular: Built and backed by Google and used by Youtube, Paypal, Google Maps, etc. Angular has been a top choice for enterprise implementations thus far. Its latest release, Angular 6, brought forward two main highlights. A promise with its Ivy renderer to speed up the rendering in the application and Angular elements which allows the use of Angular components outside of Angular, such as in Vue or React. Using the Elements Package, you can create Angular components and publish them as Web Components, which can then be used in any HTML page. For those coming from an OOP background or Java background, Angular is easier to ramp up on and learn.Alors prenez ce cours de javascript très au sérieux et regardez-le jusqu'à la fin pour apprendre les bases de la programmation et coder avec javascript de façon solide, ce cours complet javascript sera votre clé vers ces 3 autres langages de programmation étonnants.

A mon retour en France, j'ai continué à étudier l'anglais toute seule afin de le perfectionner.Plusieurs personnes me demandaient souvent de les aider à apprendre l'anglais, car ils n'y arrivaient pas tout seul. J'ai alors eu l'idée de créer un groupe Facebook et une chaîne Youtube afin de pouvoir aider le plus de personnes possible à comprendre toutes les règles spécifiques en anglais et débloquer leurs peurs et leurs freins.J'ai constaté que beaucoup de personnes avaient un très bon niveau en anglais, avec un vocabulaire très riche. Leur seul véritable difficulté était la construction de leurs phrases qui n'était pas correcte, ce qui rendait leur niveau d'anglais faible. Ainsi, j'ai décidé de créer une formation en ligne qui explique dans les détails toutes les règles afin de pouvoir parler couramment et éliminer toutes vos appréhensions pour vous exprimer en anglais.Si tu n'as aucune notion en anglais, ne t'inquiète pas, tu peux participer à cette formation sans aucun problème. Il faut bien commencer quelque part et se lancer. Cette formation convient à tout type de personne (enfants, ados, étudiants, adultes, professionnels ou personnes âges), car c'est des vidéos simples à regarder et des exercices de mise en pratique.Tu n'as pas beaucoup de temps et à peur de ne pas pouvoir suivre la formation en entier ? Ne t'inquiète pas, c'est une formation en ligne, ce qui signifie que tu peux la suivre ou tu veux et quand tu veux et surtout à ton rythme. Nous ne sommes pas pressés.

Lors de mon parcours professionnel j’ai eu l’occasion de travailler sur de très nombreux projets de développement en C comme par exemple:Jeu vidéo pour la Nintendo DSDécodeur TV pour Orange.Logiciel embarqué pour des jumelles d’observation chez Safranet bien d’autresLe C est un langage très populaire et utilisé. On le retrouve un peu partout comme par exemple dans le jeux vidéo, la plupart des logiciels PC et même dans l’embarqué. Le C est un très bon candidat si vous cherchez un 1er langage pour apprendre le développement logiciel car il comporte beaucoup de notions que l’on retrouvent dans la plupart des autres langages. Ainsi la maîtrise du C vous garantit un apprentissage beaucoup plus simple et rapide d’autres langages de programmation.Dans cette formation pour débutants et intermédiaires en développement, nous allons apprendre les bases du développement logiciel. Comment à partir de lignes de code on peut faire un logiciel exécutable sur notre machine. Puis nous verrons les bases du langage C et entre autre, comment gérer la mémoire via les variables, comment faire vivre notre programme avec les boucles et conditions ou encore comment utiliser la bibliothèque standard du C (STL) pour interagir avec l’utilisateur.Une fois ces bases acquises, nous augmenterons un peu le niveau avec les redoutables pointeurs et tableaux. c’est souvent la partie que les novices en C redoutent le plus. Mais je vous garantie qu’avec moi ça vous semblera finalement très simple ;)Alors oui c’est un gros programme mais je vous garantie que vous ne verrez pas le temps passer.La philosophie de mes coursApprendre en pratiquant : Comme le dit Richard Branson « La meilleure façon d’apprendre c’est de faire ! » Et oui, il n'y a pas de secret, plus vous pratiquerez, plus vous progresserez ! Vous trouverez alors environs 20% de théorie pour 80% de pratique dans cette formation.Apprendre en s’amusant : Vous l’avez surement remarqué, mais nous apprenons bien mieux quand les choses sont présentées de manière ludique. Vous trouverez alors dans cette formation un fil rouge sous forme d’un petit jeu vidéo un peu spécial vous verrez.

For that, we will use Tinkercad – the joyful programming and electronics simulator tool designed by Autodesk.I will teach you how to program the Arduino, how to use sensors, electric motors and all the way to creating real-life electronic circuits. We'll learn by actually practicing and analyzing real applications. But what’s truly special and valuable in this course is that the lessons are carefully designed to target specific programming and electronics concepts without getting into boring or complex details.If you do not have any experience with programming or electronics, that’s OK! Because I designed this course for the absolute beginners. The course is mainly focused on not only giving technical details but also providing real applications to explain the importance of the lecture topics. We are going to start understanding microcontrollers, especially Arduino and then we will jump right into creating our first circuit and learn basics of electrical engineering. We will learn how traffic lights works and how they are programmed to control the flow of traffic. Then, we are going to learn what is a push button and how walk buttons work to help pedestrians across the road. And after that we will understand what is a sensor and we will make an alarm system that will inform us when the burglar entered house. Following that, we are going to see how electric motors work and we will create a servo motor circuit that automates opening and closing the doors or windows. Finally, we will make Smart Home Project which provides automating the ability to control items around the house.Upon completing this course, you will have the skills and knowledge needed to create fun and useful Arduino projects.The course is regularly updated with new materials, exercises, tips and tricks that you can use in your projects!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/arduino-programming-for-kids-and-beginners-with-tinkercad/,388,Hardware,67,45,Eshgin Guluzade,No prior programming knowledge is required,"Code - one of the most necessary skills to learn

What is MAC address and how to change it ?Information Gathering: In this section you will learn how to map the current network, ie: discover all the connected devices (clients), not only that but you will also learn how to gather important information about these clients, such as their MAC address, their IP, Operating system, open ports, programs that are using these ports and maybe even the exact version of the program.MITM Attacks: in this section you will learn a number of very powerful attacks that you can launch against the network and the connected clients, these attacks will allow you to gain access to any account accessed by any client connected to your network, read all the traffic used by these clients (images , videos , audio passwords, cookies, urls ...etc), and gain full access to any client in your network. Protection: In this section you will learn how to detect these attacks and protect yourself and your network against them.All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any device connected to our network, ie: it does not matter if the device is a phone , tablet laptop ...etc. Each attack is explained in a simple way first so that you understand how it actually works, so first you will learn the theory behind each attack and then you will learn how to carry out the attack using Kali Linux.NOTE: This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih and No other organization is associated for certification exam for the same.

1082,1865140,"Arquitectura de aplicaciones - MVP, Dagger, RxJava, Retrofit","Crear aplicaciones es algo divertido y que siempre entusiasma a uno como has podido comprobar en los cursos y bootcamps de creación de apps tanto para iOS como para Android de Juan Gabriel Gomila, ¿verdad? El proceso completo de tener una idea, prepararla y plasmarla sobre el papel o una servilleta seguido de todo el proceso de escribir el código, investigar librerías y solucionar bugs hasta subirla a la App Store es sin duda una de las experiencias más gratificantes que uno pueda llevar a cabo. Incluso si no eres consciente de ello, es un proceso lucrativo, muchos somos los desarrolladores que hemos dejado nuestros trabajos regulares porque podemos vivir con los ingresos que generan nuestras apps. Hay oportunidades más que de sobra para los desarrolladores y diseñadores para vivir con los ingresos de sus propios productos. Android nos ofrece una plataforma magnífica y libre para desarrollar y subir apps a la Store de Google. La mayoría ya lo sabéis porque sois estudiantes míos en mis cursos de Android, boot camps y de patrones de diseño avanzados. Sin duda alguna estos últimos años ha cambiado muchísimo la forma en la que el software se desarrolla. Los smartphones nos permiten hacer de todo sin levantarnos del sofá: la compra, ver series y películas, que nos traigan la comida a la puerta de casa, o incluso pedir artículos electrónicos... las posibilidades son casi ilimitadas. Y pensaréis que en este panorama el mercado ha está saturado y no hay margen de mejora. Pues no! Aun hay tareas que se hacen a mano o a papel en muchos sectores y rutinas cotidianas, así que todavía uno puede sorprenderse y lanzar el próximo hit en la Store de móvil. Una buena idea puede ser el inicio de un proyecto y una idea de negocio que pueda cambiar la vida de millones de personas.Pero tanto para freelancers como empleados como desarrolladores de apps o arquitectos de aplicaciones, tanto si lanzamos una app al año o 50, tanto si mantenemos nuestras apps o contratamos a alguien para que lo haga, muchas veces nos encontramos con problemas: código repetido, errores, código spaghetti, mal documentado, elaborado sin seguir ningún patrón específico... Si alguna vez habéis hecho una app vosotros mismos, seguro que sabéis de lo que os hablo. Esto se acentúa muchísimo cada vez que queréis revisitar el código para corregir un error, un bug o lanzar una nueva actualización. Es entonces cuando entráis en un ataque de pánico y reconocéis que hacer apps no siempre es fácil y divertido, si no que muchas veces acaba siendo un gran dolor de cabeza.Por eso tenéis que aprender patrones de diseño testados, probados, y que funcionan, sobretodo los patrones de arquitectura y las herramientas asociadas a los mismos que os traigo en este curso.El núcleo fundamental del curso se basa en entender el marco teórico de cómo funciona el patrón de arquitectura del modelo vista presentador o MVP. Es un patrón de arquitectura moderno, actualizado y que aboga por la redacción de un código simple y sobretodo limpio. En el camino aparecerán otros conceptos fundamentales en los que haremos hincapié como la inyección de dependencias, la programación reactiva, las unit testings o la simulación de objetos o mocking que nos ayudaran muchísimo en nuestro camino como desarrolladores de aplicaciones. En particular haremos uso de unos frameworks muy interesantes como:Dagger II para la inyección de dependencias y librería fundamental para establecer la división de roles con MVP JUnit y Mockito para las pruebas unitarias o unit tests que agilizan la fase de testing cuando abogamos por un desarrollo  Test Driven Development o TDDRetrofit para conectarnos a APIs externas y descargar datos desde protocolos HTTP RxJava 2 para la programación reactiva que nos elevará las habilidades al máximo exponente para hacer unas apps mas funcionales e interactivas. Butter Knife para agilizar el proceso de vincular widgets de tus XML y otros recursos a tus actividades o fragmentos.Y todo en un mismo curso, donde aprenderemos juntos las habilidades de arquitectura de aplicaciones combinando la teoría con la parte práctica y de un modo escala le, con ejercicios y casos prácticos.

*** AS SEEN ON KICKSTARTER ***Learn key AI concepts and intuition training to get you quickly up to speed with all things AI. Covering:

How to start building AI with no previous coding experience using PythonHow to merge AI with OpenAI Gym to learn as effectively as possibleHow to optimize your AI to reach its maximum potential in the real world

Here is what you will get with this course:



1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.



2. Code templates – Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.



3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better results down the line.



4. Real-world solutions – You’ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 3. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.



5. In-course support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-az/,997,Universidad Inteligencia Artificial 2 Big Data Machine Learning,122,103,"Hadelin de Ponteves

1120,1694758,Ask Me Anything About Unity,"What do YOU want to know about Unity but have been afraid to ask? Do you think your questions are too trivial to become an entire course? Every day DrPenny de Bylreceives messages from her students asking for assistance on a wide variety of topics that would benefit from a short tutorial. In this course, Penny puts her 25 years of game development, research and teaching into practice to answer your questions in a variety of popular short workshop based tutorials. Topics covered include:The Unity Entity Component and Job SystemTargeting MissilesIn-game Quest SystemsReading and Writing to a Database Animating Facial Expressions Introduction to Augmented Reality for Android and iOSObject PoolingWorking with Asset BundlesContents and OverviewSection 1:The course begins with a section examining the new Unity Entity Component and Job System where you will build a planet simulation with 50,000 planets that orbit and are under the gravitational influence of four suns.Section 2:Following this, a section examining the creation of target-seeking missiles will cover basic line of sight missiles that remain locked onto a target, after being fired, as well as the addition of a waypoint system that gives missiles interesting curved and funky trajectories.Section 3:The next section steps through the ground-up creation of an in-game quest system. Starting with a simple third person game environment, you will build a quest system which monitors player progress, as well as cover the Unity fundamentals of the UI system to support its presentation.Section 4: In this section you will learn how to access an online database from inside Unity to store game data. Through the use of a free online database service, you will follow along as we create a database and write simple PHP, mySQL and C# to link a Unity application with player details stored on an external server.Section 5:If you've ever wanted to add real-time facial animations to your own characters to bring them alive, this section is for you. In it you will add emotional expressions to a character and learn how to blend between them with code. We will also add extra believability to the character by adding blinking and eye gaze dynamics.Section 6: Want to learn how to make augmented reality on your mobile phone? This section will step you through developing several augmented experiences that you can try on your Android or Apple devices. Using the Wikitude SDK with a special student license just for being enrolled, you'll have your first AR app up and running in 5 minutes.Section 7:Object Pooling is a very popular game design pattern that will help you save on memory usage. It's great if you need to create a lot of resources, such as bullets or obstacles. This section will show you how to build such a system that can be applied anywhere in your own games, through the development of an asteroid shooting game.Section 8:In this section you will learn how to work with Unity's Asset Bundles. These are external resources that you can call into your game at any time. You'll learn how to create an Asset Bundle from scratch and then how to load them into your project at runtime, from both a local drive as well as an online URL. I'll also show you how to load and swap player characters at runtime and how to expand the bundle after a games release to continue to bring in new content.What students are saying about Penny's courses:Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.Penny's teaching style is exceptionally well-motivated and illustrated.This course is awesome.

1122,309820,ASP .Net MVC Quick Start," 	 This course is a very quick workshop to take you through the basic actions that will be required for you to create an awesome, real-world CRUD web application in just a few hours (you could do it over a weekend very easily)using ASP .Net MVC, the Entity Framework (code-first development approach), and the built-in scaffolding capabilities of ASP .Net MVC. In the end, you'll have your own public-facing website to enhance your resume and show off your skills in your own e-portfolio for job interviews and applications!  	 MVC = Model, View, Controller, and is a well-known and established design pattern. Microsoft has made it extremely easy and convenient to create your web solutions using this pattern. In Microsoft's MVC framework, we find that convention is favored over configuration, so as long as we follow a few simple guidelines, the system will do a lot of the work for us.  	 We'll also be taking a quick look at how we can use the Entity Framework to easily model and create a database for us. By using the code-first approach, we'll simply create our models and then look at writing a DBContext to store the models. We'll also look at some of the more critical operations, such as building relationships and seeding our data. 	 After we've learned about the different aspects of our application, we'll quickly create a couple of controllers and use ASP .Net MVC's built-in view and scaffolding generators to easily build our CRUD operations against our database. While working on controllers we'll also look at Authentication, Authorization, and a couple of other quick security concerns.To make the solution more robust, we'll learn about using repository and service layers to separate concerns, while also keeping our models and data in their own projects. We'll also implement integration and unit testing around these layers using XUnit, Shouldly, Moq, and in-memory databases.After creating the backend portion of the site, we'll put DataTables.js on our Index view so that we can easily show the data, as well as provide built-in JavaScript tools that will filter and sort the data for us. This will make your application ""pop""when people look at it because it will be fast and easy to sort through the data and filter for results.Other things we will learn throughout the course involve the use of GIT for source control, pushing our repository to GitHub, and utilizing CI/CDthrough GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your solution to Azure.With Azure being free now, you can easily utilize the robust platform solutions available at Azure without spending any money. You'll gain experience setting up an Azure app service, configuring the connection string to connect to your Azure SQLserver and database, and you'll learn about utilizing Azure Application Insights to monitor your application, including writing your own custom events and exception handling.By the end of the course, you'll be familiar with the major working parts of creating an ASP .Net MVCCRUDapplication and publishing to a public-facing website with a fairly nice and responsive UI.You'll have working knowledge of Models, Views, and Controllers, as well as how they interact to create a functional web application.You'll also be exposed to the Entity Framework and Code First Migrations with use of a SQLServer backend.The best part is that although this sounds pretty daunting, it's actually quite easy with a majority of the work done for us by convention and tools.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/aspnet-mvc-quick-start/,1061,Web Development,155,219,Brian Gorman,"You should at least be a little familiar with Web Programming in HTML, javascript, and CSS

1126,4003980,ASP.NET Core - SOLID and Clean Architecture (.NET 5 and up),"Overview Creating a modular, testable and maintainable application in .NET Core requires a solid foundation. Setting up an application architecture requires foresight and much consideration as early decisions will impact how easily the application is extended and maintained. In the long run though, applications need to be maintained and in this case, extended. Between its design and the way the code was written, neither is really possible and so the application needs to be redesigned and future proofed. Why SOLIDArchitecture?When we talk about SOLID architecture, we are referring to isn’t a straightforward task. Decisions made early in the process can have a large impact later on, and maintainability and testability play an important role. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and facilitate more efficient agile development.SOLID stands for:S - Single-Responsibility PrincipleO - Open-closed PrincipleL - Liskov Substitution PrincipleI - Interface Segregation PrincipleD - Dependency Inversion PrincipleIn this course, you explore foundational architectural principles which help with the creation of maintainable code. Next, you discover how to set up a real-world application architecture with ASP.NET Core. Then, you’ll learn how to plug in different, common blocks such as email, authentication and have a foundation to plug-in other third-party services as needed. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of creating a testable and maintainable ASP.NET Core application needed to architect real-world, enterprise .NET Core apps.N.B. - The project in this course is based on the deliverables in Complete ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Development. While it is not mandatory to do this course, much of the existing code will be reused from this course's content.

This is a huge course. Over 10 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each module in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.We don't do things the perfect way the first time; that is not the reality of writing code. We make mistakes and point them out and fix them around them. By doing this, we develop proficiency in using debugging tools and techniques. By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in Visual Studio and examined logic and syntax errors so much, that it will be second nature for you when working in the .NET environment. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and impress your boss and coworkers.The course is complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated.

Feel free to jump to the sections that most interest you especially if you're a little bit more advanced. If you're starting from scratch or even if you're not, we do highly recommend starting from the beginning.Aspen Plus is a complex process simulator and, in our opinion, the best way to learn is with hands-on experience, by attempting each example provided in this online course, and when difficulties are encountered, by referring to the problem setup and solution that you can find in the downloadable resource section.The downloadable resources contain the input and solutions to all of the examples and workshops covered in this online course. There is a root folder for each section, within which, there are subfolders named Examples. Each example is provided in .bkp Aspen Plus format and .txt format. The .bkp files are set up as input files to view details and may be executed. The .txt files are solutions and may be viewed with Notepad. We recommend that while reading the text, Aspen Plus be used simultaneously to execute and review each example.Lastly, we have made an effort to provide the describing equations of most of the models referred to in this online course and if not possible, because of the proprietary nature of the software, we have described the functionality. Please keep in mind that Aspen Plus is a proprietary software and the source code and implementation details are not available. Additionally, there are frequently several ways to solve the equations that describe the blocks, and there is no way to ascertain these details since Aspen Technology does not provide them.------------------------------SOFTWAREHARDWARE :The Aspen Plus software, like most other software, is being developed on a continuous basis and new versions are released frequently. This online course covers Aspen Plus version 11, which is the most recent version at the moment we recorded this video.

Linear Programming, Assignment Problem, Transportation Problem, Networking Techniques, Game Theory are some of the major algorithms in Operations Research. My attempt, over the years has been to teach without involving great deal of mathematics, so that the student without any math background can also understand the algorithm easily. In the initial phase I launched the courses on Linear Programming, Assignment Problem, Transportation Problem, Sequencing at one go. Recently I launched a free course on game theory, bringing out the essential portion of game theory in a small two-hour course.This 14 and a half hour video course will give you a complete insight into solving a Hungarian Assignment Problem or a Transportation Problem. Both minimization and maximization cases will be covered, including the more complex degenerate problems. The initial Feasible solution to a transportation problem will be obtained by one of the three methods namely North West Cornet Rule, Least Cost Method or Vogel's Approximation Method. In the second phase we will cover the MoDi or Modified Distribution Method. Solution to the unbalanced Assignment Problem as also an unbalanced Transportation Problem have been covered. In dealing with the Assignment Problem, an attempt has been made to cover problems where the problem needs to be formulated as an Assignment problem before solving it. A representative problem of applying the algorithm to an scheduling problem has been covered in the course. In case of transportation problem algorithm, step by step approach to solving the problems has been covered, starting with what I call as ‘prechecks’. The idea is that the student should be able to formulate and solve the problem on his / her own. While both these algorithms are for minimisation, the problems for maximisation can also be solved by converting them into minimisation first. Examples to this effect are covered. I hope that the student will be able to formulate a given situation as one of these algorithm problems and solve it on his own.",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/operations-research-assignment-and-transportation-problem/,864,Operations Management,9,9,Madhusudan Sohani,"There are no prerequisites for the course

Are you confused by the Asterisk documentation?Do you want an easy to follow tutorial on Asterisk?Are you overwhelmed by the complexity of the Asterisk configuration?Do you have little to no experience with Linux?Are you trying to build an Asterisk phone system?  Many years ago I was very interested in learning Asterisk to replace my employers old physical phone systems. I spent a lot of time reading the documentation, using Google to search the internet, and any book I could get my hands on. Even with all of this, I was never able to build a working Asterisk phone system. I was very frustrated and was about to give up but then a friend of mine offered to tutor me. He showed me a simple step by step training starting with how to compile Asterisk software then going all the way through to configuring a working Asterisk phone system. Within a few days, I had the confidence and Asterisk skills to take any computer and turn it into a working Asterisk phone system.You need someone to show you step by step how to work with Asterisk. Using a simple to follow video guide to walk you through how to install Asterisk, write the text-based configuration files and what the network environment looks like without wasting time searching the internet or paying thousands of dollars for on-site training. You will be able to compile and install Asterisk after spending 1 hour following my step by step video tutorials. After you spend a day completing the course you will have the skill set to take any computer and turn it into an Asterisk phone system. Once you follow the course and install a couple of Asterisk systems you will be an Asterisk expert.Sure you can use google and other internet resources to teach yourself but how many months will something like that take? There will be a lot of good and bad information when reading different articles trying to piece together training materials. A lot of the documentation you will find is outdated and is not relevant anymore making your training obsolete. You also have the option of paying for Asterisk training which costs thousands of dollars for a single course and requires you to travel to the training center incurring thousands of dollars in airfare. You will also have to use your valuable vacation time. Or you could buy this course I have created with easy video tutorials for only $39 and save your self a lot of time and hassle.

If you're not certain then this Asynchronous JavaScript course is perfect for you.What

Understanding the asynchronous nature of Javascript is key to mastering the language. 

This course is designed to take someone with a beginner level knowledge of async programming and turn them into an expert.

We do this by starting off very simple, explaining the core concepts. 

Then step by step adding in layers of knowledge, punctuated by quizzes and coding challenges to cement and your knowledge before moving onto the next section.Why

I promise you'll end this course an expert in asynchronous programming in JavaScript, with knowledge most other experts don't even have.

You'll ace any JavaScript interview questions related to asynchronous code.

You'll spend less time chasing down bugs in async code.

You'll amaze your colleagues and friends with your level of knowledge and expertise in async programming.How

I will explain what async and sync code really is, the advantages and disadvantages of each.

We'll cover in-depth the various asynchronous patterns in JavaScript including Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await and even Generators with plenty of exercises to practice what you've learnt.

In the end we'll go deep into the event architecture itself,  you'll know how async code is actually implemented in these applications.Who

This course was specifically designed for those who want to improve their skills in Callbacks, Promises, Async Await, and Event Loop. This course was designed to be easy to understand, and therefore there are a lot of visuals in it, especially when we are talking about important concepts. You will also see a lot of coding examples along the way.We will be talking about 3 main components of Async JavaScript: Callback functions, Promises, and Async Await.Callbacks in JavaScript are used everywhere. Creating event handlers, making HTTP requests, interacting with the DOM, setting timeouts, reading or writing data to the filesystem, working with databases, etc. Iam pretty sure you are already using callbacks in your code, but Iam not sure if you know how they actually work... Knowing how things really work will help you write your code faster and avoid weird bugs.Promises were created as a better alternative to callbacks. They don't have drawbacks that callbacks have. JavaScript promises are incredibly helpful when you have several asynchronous operations that depend on each other. However, promises are a new concept which you have to learn, and this course will help you with that.Async Await is a syntactic sugar around Promises introduced in EcmaScript 8. Before that writing asynchronous code in JavaScript was very different from writing ordinary synchronous code. Async await allows you to structure all your code in a similar way, no matter if it's synchronous or asynchronous.There is a lot of asynchronous stuff going on in popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery, etc. In NodeJS it's almost impossible to write anything without using asynchronous operations.After watching this course you will be able to read and write asynchronous JavaScript code effectively, and you will definitely understand how it works behind the scenes!",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/asynchronous-javascript-promises-callbacks-async-await/,180,Programming Languages,42,41,Viktor Pyskunov,Basics of JavaScript,"Learn fundamental concepts of Asynchronous JavaScript

completed advert ready to post by the end.

 The course is made up
of 15 lectures.   We kick off by looking at what we can learn from
an advertising formula that has worked for decades. We delve deeper into
research telling us exactly what job hunters want to know about companies
before they apply.  We then cover the six
essentials needed to capture the attention of those perfect applicants.

Armed with this knowledge, and some outstanding examples
from companies that get this right, we then build our job advert section by
section.  

In the accompanying workbook, we walk through the
transformation of a dull job advert into something that shines.  You will be guided, step by step, on how to
do this whether you are bringing an old, lacklustre job advert to life or
starting from scratch.

1184,322818,audio engineering: EQ and Compression for beginners,"  	      Eq and compressors play a very important role in controlling and shaping music, movies, and TV shows. So it shouldnt be a surprise its the most used tools in audio engineering. Eq is widely used even outside of the audio world. Anything you do adjust the bass or treble of a sound is using eq. Car stereos, ipod, smart phones music player, computers, all have eq controls. Even when you adjust the sound presets on your TV you are using eq. With the EQ spread use of EQ in our everyday life you can see why its so important to get EQ right when we are engineering. After completing this course you will see just how powerful EQ can be.      	      Compressors arent widely used as EQ outside of audio engineering, but is still very important to learn. Using compression is the most understood tool used in audio. And because there are so many different compressors its no wonder they can be confusing.      	      This course will teach you the basics of EQ and compression. Two tools vital to becoming a good audio engineer. With over 15 years of experience in audio I will share with ways to understand what eq and compression does, as well as how its used. After this course stay tuned as I will more courses coming soon. Since Compression is always a hot topic in audio I have a few more courses on compression planned out. This course is for beginners, but even if your past a the beginning stages of engineering I encourage you to still subscribe to this course. You may learn something you didnt already know. This course will take one hour to complete and will be followed by a quiz. If you want to further your knowledge about compression check out Basics of Compression course.

1186,2512030,Audit - Financial Statement,"Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor’s conclusion and opinion.Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company’s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt  equity.Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.CPE(Continuing Professional Education)Learning Objectives1.

Whatever is happening to us outside of our workplace – whether stressful, painful, or joyful – follows us into work as well. We may think we have to keep these realities under wraps and act as if we have it all together. However, we can work better, lead successfully, and be more engaged and inspiring if – instead of trying to hide who we are – we show up fully and authentically.I'm Mike Robbins, a speaker and executive coach, and your instructor for this course. I've spent more than 20 years researching, writing, and speaking about leadership, teamwork, and high-performance. My clients have ranged from Google to Citibank, from the US Department of labor to the San Francisco Giants. From small startups in Silicon Valley to family-owned businesses in the Midwest. From what I've seen and studied over the past two decades, I believe that for us to thrive as leaders and to have the kind of impact we truly want to have on others, it’s essential to lead with authenticity.Authentic leadership is about acknowledging that we’re all vulnerable, imperfect human beings doing the best we can. It means having the courage to take risks, speak up, have compassion, ask for help, connect with others in a genuine way, and allow ourselves to be truly seen.In this course, I outline the five key principles from my book, Bring Your Whole Self to Work, that we can use to approach our own work in the spirit of openness and humanity, and to help the people we work with feel safe enough to do the same, so that the teams and organizations we’re a part of can truly succeed.In this course, you will:Identify what authenticity truly is and why it’s so important in building trustDiscover the importance of psychological safety and how to create it for your teamExpand your ability to operate with authenticityRecognize the essential difference between recognition and appreciation (and why appreciation drives higher performance)Tap into appreciation as a fuel for productivity, loyalty, and engagementEnhance your emotional intelligence in order to connect more deeply with your teamFoster a growth mindset to help your team embrace change and learningCreate a championship team by focusing on team culture and dynamicI encourage you to complete the activities and action steps in this course to put the ideas you're learning into practice immediately.

Period.Most organizations that have adopted Agile frameworks are oblivious to the fact that very few people in those organizations know how to actually write sound User Stories. Since User Stories are conversational in their verbiage, it is very hard for the un-initiated to know whether a given User Story is correct and if not, what might be missing in that User Story. Most of the time what gets passed as a User Story is simply a task or a set of tasks OR maybe an end-user's goal but without potential benefit OR a research activity, etc. There are several ways a User Story gets mis-used and totally wasted. This course will teach you to see through all this rut that exists w.r.t User Stories. Not only that, this course will teach you to quickly conceptualize and actually write User Stories. And most importantly, this course is designed to teach how to think in terms of user stories. This is a super important aspect of this course since as you know, thought precedes action. So, if you can think it, you can write it. Additionally, this course will enable you to  write precise Acceptance Criteria which are a must in order for a User Story to be worked on by development team. Moreover, course will also enlighten you on the topics of  Epics  Themes to the point that you will also be able to conceptualize and quickly write Epics and Themes.

1220,942320,"Awaken Your Heart, Creativity & Wisdom with Tara Brach","With modern living being what it is, many of us find ourselves drifting over the surface of our life in something like a trance - a distorted, pale shadow of reality and all its possibilities. It cuts off our sense of connection with our bodies, and all the aliveness and creativity of our true nature. As John O’Donohue said, “Our bodies know that they belong to life; it’s our minds that make our lives so homeless.” We can see, all around, the suffering that results: physical illness, emotional pain, a persistent sense of alienation, broken relationships… In this course created by Tara Brach, we’ll get to know what it looks like in everyday life, for each one of us, when we go off into trance -- and, how we can recover a fuller presence: for ourselves, for our loved ones, for our community and world that so need us to show up. We’ll discover how we can use ourthinking mind as a “good servant” of our well-being, rather thana saboteur.

 Each of the course’s eleven sections includes at least one experiential exercise helping students to put directly into practice the insights shared during the lectures. These exercises are essentially guided meditations that students often like to continue practicing many times over, long after a course is completed, to maintain and more fully integrate the lessons in their real, embodied, relational lives.

 We’ll learn to recognize the most common signs of being caught in trance; and, what we can do to disrupt that pattern and “hit ‘refresh’.” Then we’ll dig in deeper to understand the origins of the “default programs” that limit us, to increase our capacity for embodied presence, and to taste some of the sweet fruits of tapping into our fuller presence.

 We’ll find out how to engage skillfully with different degrees of physical pain – mild, moderate, and intense – and learn about the inter-relatedness of physical  emotional difficulties. We’ll also develop our ability to access a spaciousness that’s wide enough to embrace these difficulties, giving ourselves the best conditions to trust, to open,and to thrive.

 We’ll look into our habitual belief in separateness, and typical reactive behaviors of avoiding -- or grasping at -- more closeness in relationships. We’ll go through three steps to freeing ourselves from the trance of that isolated small-self, and restoring our connection to awareness  love in the midst of stressful situations. Finally, we’ll discover how we can actively re-awakenagain and again into the fully-embodied, profound belonging with all of life that is our birthright.

Part 6/611. “Planning your answer”: This video helps you in how to plan and write your answer based on best practices and content/info from the examiner's report up to early 2020. You need to make sure that you do certain things in order for your answer to include the elements expected by ACCA as well as understanding the 'feel', 'layout', 'logic' in terms of planning.“5 Ws by Dino for SBL”: A simple exam technique to use to answer an SBL requirement. Check it carefully to ensure your answer is effective!How to write professionally for SBL: An extremely useful video on how to write effectively based on the reporting layout. What the examiners expect, how to space your answer, introduce, conclude, make a slide and other useful tips in gaining marks.14. “A simple way to understand the skills for SBL”: The skills for ACCA's SBL are 5 and they are Communication, Evaluation, Analysis, Commercial Acumen and Scepticism. In this 5 minute video, I explain the competencies in a simple, yet effective way to help you understand what is expected by the examining team.15. “Common layouts for SBL”: For SBL, you will be asked to write your answer in a specific layout such as a 'report', a 'press release' a 'letter' a ""Project Initiation Document"", a briefing paper or even make Powerpoint slides. This video explains what is expected from candidates and how to write as well as the type of layout in each and every style. Remember, writing effectively, following instructions and using the correct layout give points and these are crucial in passing the exam!16. “Description of how to know which model to use in SBL”: This is a 'key' video in understanding WHICH MODEL or THEORY to use based on KEY WORDS from SBL's material. For example, the word competition leads to using 5 forces theory while evaluation of strategies leads candidates to use the ""Suitability, Acceptability. Feasibility"" (SAF) model. There are 25 key words to remember so take notes!17. Can I pass SBL just by using common sense?: Given that SBL is all about simulating the workplace and being 'professional' and acting in a professional manner, many students ask if it is possible to pass purely by using common sense and not using any model and theory to support their answers. The quick answer is YES they can. Listen to this short, yet interesting video on this point.“ACCA SBL FAQs” – Answers to student questions about the SBL exam: This video goes over – and answers specifically – common questions that students ask about ACCA’s SBL exam. For example, can a student use 2 theories? Can you gain more than 1 mark for a valid point etc. Check it out! ALSO GOOD FOR YOUTUBEREPLACED with PREVIOUS with same title: Why candidates fail ACCA’s SBL: Candidates fail because they usually fail to analyse and extend their answers. Watch this video to ensure you do not make these mistakes and how to ensure you do pass at first attempt. – ALSO GOOD FOR YOUTUBE PLEASE20. “Corporate Governance”: is the starting point, as it is the way in which companies are directed and controlled in the best interests of stakeholders. The logic in the course is to start analysing a company from TOP to bottom. From Governance and Structure along with Ethics to Implementation.21. “Key concepts of corporate governance”: A 'must see' video as the content in this video can be used for almost EVERY answer relating to corporate governance and business ethics. This video can give you additional marks if used in such questions/requirements.22. “Stakeholders”: Understanding Stakeholders, mapping them and checking their conflict is crucial for every organization. Stakeholders are those individuals and groups that have an interest and/or can influence the organization. It is important for the organization to SATISFY them all to ensure its smooth operations. Remember that.23. “Agency theory” (or relationship) is the foundation upon which governance exists. Companies have 'agents' working on behalf of the owners. These agents need to always work in the best interest of the company and protect the company's interests.24. “Board of Directors”: The most CENTRAL element in Governance. Most companies, especially listed companies have a board (or even 2 boards), that supervise, create the mission and strategy of the organization and have to collectively protect the company. This video has all the relevant information about the board in less than 4 minutes, such the role of Non Executive Directors, the types of boards, the reason for committees, diversity and other important elements.25. Board Diversity: A very interesting video on why a board needs to be Diverse. People with different expertise, know-how, from different backgrounds, yound and old, men and women, different religions, from different geographical areas always help in providing different viewpoints, ideas and challenging concepts. A good board is a diverse board.Chairman  CEO: A short video on the difference between the Chairman and CEO, their roles in a business and it is best practice for two people to hold these positions and not the same person (segregation of duties)27. “Corporate Governance Country Frameworks”: Every country has its own laws and therefore countries can provide the framework within which listed companies need to operate. This video explains the main differences between the UK's Corporate Governance Code and the USA's Sarbanes Oxley Act and why codes matter along with their pros and cons.28. “Risk Management Process”: A very concise video on the Risk Management Process. Extremely important in understanding how to Manage Risk in a logical sequence. This video can help you answer Risk Management requirements in the exam.29. “Code of Ethics”: Codes of Ethics are very important for organisations. Watch this video to understand why and how they play an important role for companies, how they support professionalism of employees and what some classic 'contents' would be if asked to prepare an outline.30. “Corporate Responsibility” is an element of effective Corporate Governance. In this short video, CR is explained, defined and also some of the most important responsibilities of companies are noted to remember for the exam.31. “CPD – Continuing Professional Development”: A short video to watch WHY board directors need to also continue to update their knowledge the same way ACCA members should. The rationale is the same. Changes happen dramatically these days and therefore it is essential to be able to cope and stay up to date in order to be effective.32. “Vision and Mission” begins the Strategic part of SBL. Every company must have a vision and a mission. The terms are 'abused' unfortunately in the real world, however their importance remains and they are 'different'. Vision is the grad idea and Mission how to get there. Recent theories also talk about the mission being the PURPOSE of the organization (see SInek, 2007 - Start with Why).33. “External Analysis”: A short video on what ""EXTERNAL ANALYSIS"" means. As you have probably seen in the previous videos as well as in the FLOWCHART, companies can be broken into 2 sections, External and Internal. External means everything happening outside the company's doors and Internal everything that happens within the company's doors. This is useful as if there is a requirement in the exam that has to do with environment or competition, you should know where to look and what to use from that area of the flowchart.34. “PESTEL”: This video explains one of the most 'classic' models in business, PESTEL which can be used if the requirement asks you to analyse, or evaluate the 'environment' in the case. Of course you may also be asked to demonstrate understanding of 'commercial acumen' which implies - in most cases - understanding the way an organization operates within its environment. Don't be afraid to use this model alongside other 'external' models as indicated in the flowchart.35. “5 Forces Theory”: A concise video on understanding Michael Porter's 5 forces theory which is used to evaluate the competitive environment or the 'profitability' of an industry. As Porter suggests, every industry is different but this model can be used to understand where the organization can actually make money in its industry and where it is probably losing money (i.e. supplier power forcing margins down or high customer power due to low switching costs etc.). Extremely important for the exam.36. “Porter’s Diamond”: An amazing model explaining why and how COUNTRIES (not companies) can have a national competitive advantage. As it can be assumed, if a country has some unique resources (i.e. oil, climate, know-how etc.) it can have a competitive advantage thus making organisations operating in such an environment possibly benefit from this uniqueness by operating in that country or even taking PART of their operation in their supply chain to that country. For example, Apple designs phones in the USA taking advantage of the US's talent in innovation and design, while it assembles the phone (at least until the time of publishing this course) in China, thus taking advantage of the top quality resources (talent) in China in terms of technology know-how, scalability for production and market.37. “Internal Analysis”: A short video on understanding what ""internal"" analysis means - along the lines of ""external"". Here, I include elements and theories that relate to ""INSIDE"" the company (like strategy, Critical Success factors, Value chain, Portfolio, strategy etc.)38. Critical Success Factors  Balanced Scorecard: This video explains the concept of Critical Success Factors and why it is important for companies to focus on what ‘Really” matters in business. The basis upon which the Balances Scorecard was developed in 1990 was the CSFs, and therefore an explanation on what the Balanced Scorecard is, is provided.39. “Big Data”: An extremely important video on the topic of our era (big data). Data is the new 'oil' and companies need data to understand trends, forecast demand, make budgets and make predictions based on the data they collect and 'mine'. In the 21st century data is becoming more and more important as it is coming very fast (Velocity), is of different kind (Variety) and we are overwhelmed by how much data is being produced (volume) due to the fast pace of our world, globalisation and 24/7 connectivity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to create more data...40. “Porter’s Generic Strategies”: Companies need to have a 'generic strategy' to compete in its market. This video explains the Generic Strategies model in an extremely simple way to help you understand what it is all about along with examples.41. “The BCG Matrix” (Boston Consulting Group Matrix) examines a company's portfolio of services or products but can also be used for a company's subsidiary products. Understand in this video what cash cows, stars, question marks and dogs mean in strategy terms.42. “Value Chain”: The value chain is based on the assumption that VALUE is CREATED or ADDED when 9 activities within companies are COORDINATED well. These activities are broken down into 2 groups (support and primary) and only if these activities are based on the company's generic strategy/philosophy and work in a coordinated, effective and efficient way, the company can add value.Benchmarking: This video explains the concept of benchmarking, how it is used, its advantages as well as its disadvantages for organizations. It also mentions some examples.44. “Culture”: If there is a question on culture in the exam, you can use the 7 elements of the Cultural Web, a very useful model/theory that examines 7 areas to understand a company's culture.45. “Market Segmentation”: Among the top areas that are important to know in marketing is segmentation. Companies need to know the profiles of their customers and when organising them into homogenous groups, this is called segmentation. Watch this video to understand the area and explain it in the context of the SBL case if it comes up.46. “Marketing Mix – 7 P’s”: This video talks about and explains probably the most important marketing theory in the world, the Marketing mix, also known as 7 P's. In the older days it was called '4P's however if an organization is offering a 'service' 7 P's may be more appropriate.47. “6 I's Elements” in Marketing refers to the characteristics and advantages for Marketing on-line in a digital way. All elements start with an ""I"" so we can remember them better.48. “SWOT analysis”: One of the most well-known business models of all time. You may not be asked to undertake a SWOT analysis for the exam but you may be asked to state the POSITION of the company. If you see this word, it implies SWOT which is a static but very important model to list and analyse the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of a company. Remember to ANALYSE the points raised within the context of the case, not just list them. Strengths and Weaknesses are usually internal areas (found from inside the company), while Opportunities and Threats are from outside the company (External areas).49. “Directional Policy Matrix”: This video explains how many directions a company can take towards growth. The simplicity of Ansoff's model featured is amazing. After the SWOT analysis comes growth usually and the direction chosen is based on the SWOT (position). After directions, methods follow.50. “Methods for Growth”: This video explains the various methods a company has to grow after the direction from Ansoff's model is chosen. Practically speaking there are about 7 methods that companies use: Licensing, Franchising, Merger, Acquisition, Joint Venture (or Alliance), Organic and Exporting. In the exam, if you are asked to EVALUATE a strategy such as one of these you need to examine it by asking 3 words: Suitability, Acceptability and Feasibility (next video in sequence).51. “Suitability, Acceptability, Feasibility (SAF)”: This video explains how to evaluate a strategic direction chosen. For example, if a company decides to acquire another company, is this strategy Suitable for the organization? Is it Acceptable? is it Feasible? In your answer you need to know the pros and cos of acquisitions and ask yourself questions such as is this idea acceptable to the stakeholders of the company? Is it feasible? Does the company have capabilities? Resources? know-how? Does the company have cash etc. etc.52. “Change Management”: A very important topic of our era. What is change? Why is it important? Why are people resistant? How can we manage change? Watch this video to get the basics on change and some examples that you can use for the exam.53. “Project Management”: This video is a Mini Project Management course on the ""basics of project management"". It includes what projects are, their constraints, the role of the project manager, the business case, the PID, the lessons learnt, the tools Project Managers use and other important points to help you understand the topic towards preparing for the exam.54. Leadership: A video on a very challenging topic. It goes over the difference between leadership and management, the traits of a good leader and some of the basic theories and styles of leadership like the situational leadership model;",https://thincrs-one.udemy.com/course/acca-strategic-business-leader-sbl-video-based-course/,219,Accounting,53,53,"Dr Constantine ""Dino"" Kiritsis","Registered with the ACCA, however extremely useful for anyone intending to learn more about MBA concepts","Exam technique, time management and handling the exhibits!

I started with Amazon's free self-study video series, but there is no way that the information contained in that series would have been enough. I also purchased a video course provided via Udemy, it was very helpful in filling in some details about the terminology in services that AWS offers, it still wouldn't have been enough. These practice exams are exactly what I needed.These practice exams are worded very similarly to what you'll see on the exams, but are not verbatim. In fact, I found the that way these questions are worded lead me to learn more about the technology areas that the exam focuses on, helping ensure a positive result.Also, and this is very important. The instructor(?) is very active in the QA area. S/He responds quickly to questions, and provides clear answers, often with links to the material that supports the answer.This is the practice exam series you want!Tracy Norrell⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Yesterday, I passed this exam on my first attempt.

Take one, 65-question quiz every other day. 3. Pass or fail, review your results, read (and research) the explanations. Watch your scores dramatically improve. 4.

1261,2558142,AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Full Practice Exam,"Nervous about the AWSCertified Machine Learning Specialty exam?You should be! It's arguably the toughest certification exam AWS offers, as it not only tests AWS-specific knowledge, but your practical experience in machine learning and deep learning in general. It's tough to know what to expect on the exam before going in.This practice exam offers a realistic, full-length simulation of what you can expect in the AWSMLS-C01 exam. It's not a ""brain dump,"" but a complete, 65-question, 3-hour practice exam with original questions of the same style, topics, difficulty, and breakdown of the real exam. It's a great test of your readiness before you decide to invest in the real exam, and a great way to see what sorts of topics the exam will touch on. We also include a 10-question warmup test that will give you a rough idea of your readiness in just a half an hour.The author of this exam, Frank Kane, is a popular machine learning instructor on Udemy who passed the AWSCertified Machine Learning exam himself on the first try - as well as the AWS Certified Big Data Specialty exam, which the Machine Learning exam builds upon.

And you'll need a strong knowledge of AWSsecurity, including use of KMS and IAM.But AWS knowledge is not enough to pass this practice exam, or the real thing! You also need deep knowledge on data science, feature engineering and tuning your machine learning models. Do you really understand regularization techniques and how to use them? Do you really understand precision, recall, and AUC? Do you know how different deep learning models work, and how they are used? This practice exam will let you find out. Every question includes an explanation of the correct answer as well.Don't risk hundreds of dollars and hours of your time on the AWSCertified MachineLearning Exam until you're sure you're ready for it.

We will learn such tactics for dealing with backups and restores across cloud using SQL Server database on RDS with a client tool.AWS Relational Database Service (Oracle) - We will spend some time to learn how to stand up Oracle on AWS RDS, especially for Oracle professionals.AWS Relational Database Service (MySQL) - After spending time on practicing basic concepts, with MySQL database on AWS RDS, we will start practicing advanced concepts for High-Availability and Performance, like Read Replicas and Performance Insights features.AWS Relational Database Service (PostgreSQL) - There can be use-cases where there may be need to convert one database to another on cloud, for example convert PostgreSQL to MySQL. We will learn about some compatibility features where we can create a MySQL read replica from a PostgreSQL instance and make a read replica as an independent database.AWS Relational Database Service (Aurora) - Aurora on AWS RDS is a native database service from AWS. It comes in two flavors - cluster hosted and serverless, which is suitable for different use-cases. Also the storage architecture of Aurora is shared by various other AWS services like AWS Neptune and DocumentDB. We will learn this service in-depth.AWS Neptune - Relational databases is just one of the types of databases in the industry as well as on AWS. Graph is special use-case for very densely connected data where the value of relationships is much higher than normal. We will learn graph theory of RDF vs Property Graph, and learn how Neptune fits in this picture, stand-up a Neptune Server as well as client, and operate on it with query languages like Gremlin ( Tinkerpop ) and SPARQL.AWS DocumentDB (Nov 2018 Release) - MongoDB is one of the industry leader in NoSQL Document Databases. AWS has recently introduced this new service which is a native implementation of AWS to provide an equivalent database with MongoDB compatibility. We will learn details of the same.AWS DynamoDB - Key-value databases are important for housing voluminous data typically logs, tokens etc. We will learn document database implementation in depth with advanced features like streaming, caching, data expiration and more.AWS API Gateway - REST APIs are today's standard mechanism of data ingestion. We will learn how to build data ingestion and access pipeline with APIs using this service with AWS DynamoDB.AWS Lambda - Microservices are often tied with APIs, and are the cornerstone of any programmatic integration with AWS Services, typically AWS's Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Services. We will learn developing Lambda functionsAWS CloudWatch - System logging is at the center of all programmatic logic execution, and it ties very closely with microservices and metrics logging for a variety of AWS Services. We will learn how to access and log data from microservices in CloudWatch logs.AWS Internet of Things (IoT) - Today IoT is one of the fastest growing areas, and from a data perspective, its one of the most valued source of data. The first challenge enterprises phase is the mechanism of ingesting data from devices and then processing it. With prime focus on ingestion, we will learn how to solution this using an end-to-end practical example which reads data from a device and sends text messages on your cell phone.AWS Data Pipeline - With Data Lakes already overflowing with data, moving data within cloud repositories and from on-premises to AWS requires an orchestration engine which can move the data around with some processing. We will learn how to solve this use-case with this service.Amazon Redshift and Redshift Spectrum - All stored data in relational or non-relational format needs to be analyzed and warehoused. We will learn how to cater the requirement for a peta-byte scale, massively parallel data warehouse using this service.AWS ElasticSearch - ElasticSearch is one of the market leaders in search framework along with its alternative Apache Solr. AWS provides its own managed implementation of ElasticSearch, which can be used as one of the options to search data from different repositories. We will learn how to use this service for addressing search use-cases, and understand how tools like Logtash and Kibana fits in the overall solution.AWS CloudSearch - Standing up an AWS ElasticSearch needs some ElasticSearch specific understanding. For use-cases which needs a more managed solution, AWS provides an alternative packaged solution for search based on Apache Solr. We will learn how to stand up this service and use if for standing up search solutions in an express manner.AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) - After spending sufficient time on Ingestion, Migration, Storage, Databases, Search and Processing, now we will enter the world of Big Data Analytics where we will spend significant amount of time learning how to standup a Hadoop based cluster and process data with frameworks like Spark, Hive, Oozie, EMRFS, Tez, Jupyter Notebooks, EMR Notebooks, Dynamic Port Forwarding, RStudio on EMR, Read and Process data from S3 in EMR, Integrate Glue with Hive, Integrate DynamoDB with Hive and much more.AWS Backup (Nov 2018 Release) - Creating backup routines of various data repositories is a Standard Operating Procedure of production environments.

We will learn how to use this AP powered service to extract text from speech, and how it can be effectively used for a number of use-cases.AWS Polly - We would have covered many use-cases of processing textual data from one form to another, but processing text to speech, which is the exact opposite function of Transcribe, we will learn to perform that with this AI powered service from AWS. We will also learn the use of Speech Synthesis Language to control the details of the speech that gets generated.AWS SageMaker - After comfortably using AI powered service, which abstracts the complexity of machine learning models from end-users, we will now venture in the world of machine learning with this service. We will execute a machine learning model end-to-end and learn how to access data from S3, create a model, create notebooks for executing code to explore and process data, train - build - deploy machine learning model, tune hyper-parameters, and finally accessing it from a load balanced infrastructure using API endpoints.AWS Personalize - Recommendation Engines requires building a reinforced deep learning neural network. Amazon has been in the business of recommending products to customers since decades. They have packages their method of recommendation as a product and launched it as a service, which is making a debut in the form of Personalize. We will perform an end-to-end exercise to understand how to use this service for generating recommendations.AWS Lake Formation (Nov 2018 Release) - As forming data lakes is a tedious process, AWS has introduce a set of orchestration steps in the form of service to expedite the generation of Data Lakes. As this service is in early preview (Beta) and is subject to change, we will look at a preview of the GUI of this service before concluding the curriculum of this course.If you are not sure whether this course is right for you, feel free to drop me a message and I will be happy to answer your question related to suitability of this course for you.

1293,1625530,AWS DynamoDB - The Complete Guide (Build 18+ Hands On Demos),"This course starts from scratch!  You’ll learn Amazon DynamoDB from the ground up. No prior knowledge of DynamoDB is necessary! Join the most comprehensive DynamoDB course ever. From basic to advanced topics in AWS DynamoDB, you get to learn it all! You’ll not only learn, but master DynamoDB, the cloud database from Amazon.  While you learn, if you need my help, just ask. You’ll receive prompt support both via direct messaging or discussion. Amazon DynamoDB is a fast, flexible, serverless NoSQL database service from Amazon that scales on-demand to support virtually unlimited concurrent Read/Write operations, with sub-millisecond response times.This Course uses Node.js and JavaScript  For all the demos that require the use of AWS SDKs, we'll use the AWS SDK for JavaScript. APIs are implemented on Node.js.  Knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript is good to have for taking this course. This shouldn’t however stop you from taking the course. If you are new to JavaScript or Node.js, I cover the JavaScript fundamentals as an optional section inside this course.  The JavaScript and Node.js topics covered in the course will help you get up and running with using the AWS SDK and perform the demos presented in this course. However, keep in mind that, as this course is not a JavaScript or Node.js course.  The course also uses Angular and Ionic for Web and Mobile app demos. Knowledge of Angular or Ionic, however is not required for you to be able to complete the demos presented in the course.Get a very solid grasp on how to use DynamoDB in practiceThis course will teach you all the fundamentals of DynamoDB as well as advanced DynamoDB topics. You’ll learn how to design DynamoDB tables using the DynamoDB best practices, how to use DAX or DynamoDB Accelerator for faster performance, how to reduce DynamoDB costs, how to perform efficient scaling and how to use AWS SDK to integrate highly-scalable web as well as highly-scalable mobile applications with DynamoDB.This course follows a hands-on approachWe’ll build fully functional cross-platform web as well as mobile apps supporting social media login and providing a uniform user experience across devices and platforms.This course demonstrates all the advanced features of DynamoDB, hands-on, and step by step. Simply watching me integrate DynamoDB with other AWS services and implementing web and mobile apps, will take your DynamoDB skills to the next level.  We will cover the latest DynamoDB features like DAX, Global tables, Auto-Scaling, Data Encryption, On-demand, Scheduled, as well as Continuous backups and Point-in-Time Recovery.  We’ll also cover hands-on demos on topics like integrating DynamoDB with S3, AWS Lambda, Cognito, Data Pipeline, Redshift, Apache Hive on EMR, CloudWatch, CloudTrail among others.  We’re also going to build RESTful API that connects to the DynamoDB backend with a Fine-Grained Access Control in place. We will then take this further and integrate a highly-scalable web application or a single page application with DynamoDB.And then we’ll integrate DynamoDB with highly-scalable iOS app as well as an Android app. All these three apps, web, iOS and Android apps will use Google login for user authentication. We'll do this by implementing social OAuth 2.0 based login with Federated Access using AWS Cognito.  Look through the course curriculum above for the complete list of demos covered.  By the end of this course, you’ll have mastered Amazon DynamoDB and you’ll be confident and be fully equipped to tackle even advanced level DynamoDB projects.Take a look at what my existing students have said about this course: ""The ""AWS DynamoDB - The Complete Guide"" is one of the best classes I have ever taken in person or online. Riyaz is thorough in his coverage of the topic. This practical Guide not only taught me the specifics of DynamoDB, but it also spoke to its typical ecosystem of transactional and batch solutions.

1301,2482596,AWS: Cloud-Native com Terraform & Serverless Framework,"ESTE NĀO É UM CURSO PARA INICIANTES____________________________________________0. Por quê eu deveria comprar este curso?R: Serverless é um conceito que veio para ficar. As empresas (pequenas e grandes) estão adotando este paradigma cada vez mais, principalmente pela escalabilidade e facilidade de uso que este conceito fornece. Por ser algo relativamente novo (cerca de 5 anos), muitas pessoas ainda não sabem como resolver problemas simples com Serverless, tais como deploy em diferentes ambientes, gerenciamento de dependências, ambiente de execução, como manter aplicações Stateless de verdade, etc. A ideia é que você consiga dar um grande passo ao terminar este curso e esteja pronto para gerenciar aplicações Serverless do início ao fim.E por último, mas não menos importante: eu me preocupo com o seu tempo! Por isso, minhas aulas são sempre mão na massa e, quando possível, eu utilizo a famosa técnica de copy/paste para que os vídeos fiquem mais curtos, porém, eu SEMPRE explico tudo que está sendo criado nas aulas, e o copy/paste só é utilizado quando já fizemos algo parecido e podemos simplesmente alterar alguns parâmetros. Em hipótese alguma começaremos uma aula com código que não foi gerado em aulas anteriores, garantindo que, se você seguir as aulas, o conteúdo estará sempre alinhado.Caso você tenha dúvidas, estarei sempre a disposição para respondê-las na seção de Perguntas Respostas. Caso deseje, você pode também mandar uma mensagem privada.1. Este curso é para mim?R: Este curso é para você somente se você possui interesse em algum(ns) desse(s) tópico(s):aplicações serverlessinfraestrutura imutávelAWSdesenvolvimento, mas também infraestruturaDevOps, mas também desenvolvimentotecnologia de pontaAlém, de claro, ter a força de vontade de replicar o conteúdo das aulas no seu próprio ambiente. A prática é a única maneira de memorizar e aprender todo o conteúdo passado nas aulas. Já te adianto que o curso não é fácil, mas com calma e perseverança será possível extrair muitos resultados positivos.Se você não tem interesse nestes tópicos ou já sabe absolutamente tudo sobre eles, então este curso NĀO é para você.2. Qual o nível técnico que eu preciso para realizar este curso?R: Para tirar o máximo proveito deste curso, você precisa ter familiaridade com desenvolvimento de software (no curso utilizaremos Node.js) e conceitos de sistemas distribuídos e desacoplamento de sistemas.3. Oque eu vou de fato aprender?R: Você aprenderá a criar o backend (e somente o backend) de aplicações 100% Serverless utilizando uma stack pra lá de moderna. Criaremos um sistema genérico (e simplista) de reservas e notificações. A cada reserva agendada, uma notificação será enviada para um e-mail pré-configurado por ambiente (dev, prod), assim como uma mensagem SMS usando MessageBird! Você aprenderá a proteger suas funções Lambda com autenticação e autorização com JWT, assim como a salvar dados no DynamoDB. Além disso, as notificações serão disparadas assincronamente e irão reagir a eventos de INSERT no DynamoDB . Também usaremos tópicos SNS e filas SQS para conseguir desacoplar os producers dos consumers. assim como DLQs (DeadLetterQueue) para analisar mensagens que possam vir a falhar. Todos os recursos serão acessados usando o Princípio do Privilégio Mínimo, o que significa que as permissões de acesso entre recursos na Cloud serão restritas ao mínimo necessário, garantindo uma camada extra de segurança.Em cima de tudo isso, você criará infraestrutura imutável com Terraform. Os recursos criados pelo Terraform serão:IAM RolesIAM PoliciesDynamoDB TablesDynamoDB IndexesDynamoDBStreamsTópicos SNSFilas SQSalém de exportar todos este parâmetros para o AWS Systems Manager para que possam ser consumidos pelo Serverless Framework e, aproveitando a deixa, criaremos os seguintes recursos este framework:Endpoints API GatewayFunções LambdaVocê executará comandos como:Terraform:terraform initterraform planterraform apply (-auto-approve)terraform destroy (-auto-approve)e irá entender como usar templates, interpolação de variáveis , condicionais e trafegar variáveis entre módulos no Terraform 2. Serverless Framework:sls deploy (--stage x --region x)sls remove (--stage x --region x)além de criar arquivos .yml dinâmicos que buscam valores do AWS SSM, deixando-os, assim, preparados para a replicação entre ambientes.No fim do curso, replicaremos todo o ambiente criado durante as aulas em um ambiente completamente novo, justamente para mostrar que a infraestrutura criada é imutável e facilmente replicável. E o melhor de tudo: criaremos um script .sh que vai criar toda a nossa infraestrutura na Cloud. Ou seja, com um simples comando você conseguirá subir mais de 50 recursos na AWS. E para finalizar, criaremos um outro script .sh para derrubar todo o ambiente e voltar para o estado original da nossa conta na AWS.4. Oque este curso não ensina?R: Este curso NĀO ensina:programação básicaconceitos de async/await em Node.jsshell scriptingcomandos básicos Unixconceitos básicos de Cloud Computing (o que é Cloud, o que é um servidor, etc)VPCsFrontend5. Sou iniciante e quero fazer o curso mesmo assim. Posso?R: Tecnicamente, não há nada que eu possa fazer para lhe impedir de comprar este curso. Porém, para tirar proveito do mesmo, é ideal que você tenha vivência no mundo de desenvolvimento de Software. Você precisa ter passado por problemas suficientes para conseguir entender porque infraestrutura imutável é relevante e porque processamento assíncrono é importante. Se você ainda assim tem interesse, eu tenho um curso completamente gratuito e introdutório sobre aplicações Serverless que você pode fazer sem investir um centavo. Ao finalizá-lo, talvez este curso consiga atender mais suas expectativas. Para ver este outro curso, basta clicar no meu perfil aqui no Udemy e se inscrever gratuitamente.6. Comparado aos outros cursos do Udemy, eu achei este um pouco caro.R: Eu entendo. No entanto, este é um material pioneiro em português e muito tempo foi investido para trazer um conteúdo profissional, que é utilizado no mundo real. Além disso, meu suporte para alunos com dúvidas é excelente (se nenhuma tragédia acontecer, eu sempre respondo em até 24 horas). Ovalor do curso também serve para filtrar alunos desinteressados e que saem comprando cursos devido ao baixo preço.

Through the completion of our six practice exams, you will gain all the necessary knowledge to successfully pass your Azure qualification exam. This course is in line with the latest updated Azure content, as of November 9th, 2020.The number of questions on the AZ900 is 44, and the time limit is 60 minutes.About one-third of the questions are ""TRUE"" and ""FALSE"", questions, matching the real-world exam scenario as best as possible.Since Udemy cannot set three ""TRUE"" and ""FALSE"" type questions as one question (like in the Azure exam), it is necessary to set multiple individual ""TRUE"" and ""FALSE"" type questions. The total number of questions is 60.The content of these practice exams are the fundamentals required of all Azure professionals. The benefits of completing this Azure qualification exam course are not only limited to only ITengineers alone, as this is perfect for all whom interact with Azure in their daily work, in any capacity.

However, the following types of questions cannot be answered in Udemy's online test environment format.- Udemy does not allow the question format in which you match multiple services. We have substituted this question format with the ""service name matching"" type questions.- Udemy cannot make a set of three connected ""True"" or ""False"" format questions , so we will split each of these into individual questions, still testing the same overall content.Due to Udemy's specifications, the above two question formats are not possible so we have done our best to facilitate a substitution that will still test the same Azure understanding.

1343,4035666,Azure Data Engineering - Build Data Ingestion Engine Project,"The main objective of this course is to help you to learn Data Engineering techniques of building Metadata-Driven frameworks with Azure Data Engineering tools such as Data Factory, Azure SQL, and others.Building Frameworks are now an industry norm and it has become an important skill to know how to visualize, design, plan and implement data frameworks.The framework that we are going to build together is referred to as the Metadata-Driven Ingestion Framework. Data ingestion into the data lake from the disparate source systems is a key requirement for a company that aspires to be data-driven, and finding a common way to ingest the data is a desirable and necessary requirement. Metadata-Driven Frameworks allows a company to develop the system just once and it can be adopted and reused by various business clusters without the need for additional development, thus saving the business time and costs. Think of it as a plug-and-play system.The first objective of the course is to onboard you onto the Azure Data Factory platform to help you assemble your first Azure Data Factory Pipeline. Once you get a good grip of the Azure Data Factory development pattern, then it becomes easier to adopt the same pattern to onboard other sources and data sinks.Once you are comfortable with building a basic azure data factory pipeline, as a second objective we then move on to building a fully-fledged and working metadata-driven framework to make the ingestion more dynamic, and furthermore, we will build the framework in such a way that you can audit every batch orchestration and individual pipeline runs for business intelligence and operational monitoring.Creating your first PipelineWhat will be covered is as follows;1. Introduction to Azure Data Factory2. Unpack the requirements and technical architecture3. Create an Azure Data Factory Resource4. Create an Azure Blob Storage account5. Create an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 Storage account6. Learn how to use the Storage Explorer7. Create Your First Azure Pipeline.Metadata Driven Ingestion1. Unpack the theory on Metadata Driven Ingestion2. Describing the High-Level Plan for building the User3. Creation of a dedicated Active Directory User and assigning appropriate permissions4. Using Azure Data Studio5.
